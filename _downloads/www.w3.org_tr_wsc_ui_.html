    security context information to end-users.

    <p><em>This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C technical reports index</a> at http://www.w3.org/TR/.</em></p>


    <p>Please see the Working Group's <a href=
    "wsc-impl.html">implementation report</a>.</p>

    <p>To frame its development of this specification, the Working
    Group had previously published a use case note <a href=
    "#ref-wsc-usecases">[WSC-USECASES]</a>. This specification
    addresses most of the use cases and issues documented in that
    note by documenting best existing practice, with the following
    exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This specification does not include advice for web site
        authors.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>This specification does not provide advice to address
        the issue explained in sections <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-wsc-usecases-20080306/#extended-chrome">
        9.1.2 Visually extending the chrome</a> and <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-wsc-usecases-20080306/#information-bar">
        9.2.7 Information bar (aka: notification bar)</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, section <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-wsc-usecases-20080306/#usability-testing">
    10.4 Implementation and testing</a> of <a href=
    "#ref-wsc-usecases">[WSC-USECASES]</a> articulated an
    expectation that the recommendations in this specification
    would be subject to usability testing, at least on a low
    fidelity level, and that such testing would form part of the
    Candidate Recommendation exit criteria. Resources available to
    the Working Group at this point will not permit the group to
    conduct extensive usability testing. At the same time, the
    focus of this specification has shifted toward documenting best
    existing practice.</p>

    <p>This document was developed by the <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/2006/WSC/">Web Security Context Working
    Group</a>. For a list of changes to this document since its
    Proposed Recommendation version, please refer to the <a href=

<p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.</p>

      <p>This specification deals with the trust decisions that
      users must make online, and with ways to support them in
      making safe and informed decisions where possible.</p>

      <p>In order to achieve that goal, this specification includes
      recommendations on the presentation of identity information
      by user agents, <a href="#identity-requirement"><b>6.1.1
      Identity Signal</b></a>. We also include recommendations on
      conveying error situations in security protocols. The error
      handling recommendations both minimize the trust decisions
      left to users, and represent known best practice in inducing
      users toward safe behavior where they have to make these
      decisions. To complement the interaction and decision related
      parts of this specification, <a href="#Robustness"><b>7
      Robustness Best Practices</b></a> addresses the question of
      how the communication of context information needed to make
      decisions can be made more robust against attacks.</p>

      <p>This document specifies user interactions with a goal
      toward making security usable, based on known best practice
      in this area. This document is intended to provide user
      interface guidelines. Most sections assume the audience has a
      certain level of understanding of the core PKI (Public Key
      Infrastructure) technologies as used on the Web. The
      following sections are relevant to all readers and do not
      require a thorough understanding of PKI: <a href=
      "#Conformance"><b>3 Conformance</b></a>, <a href=
      "#concepts"><b>4 Interaction and content model</b></a>,
      <a href="#indicators"><b>6 Indicators and
      Interactions</b></a>, <a href="#error-handling"><b>6.4 Error

      Robustness Best Practices</b></a> and <a href=
      "#security-considerations-warning-fatigue"><b>8.5 Warning
      Fatigue</b></a>. Since this document is part of the W3C
      specification process, it is written to clearly lay out the
      requirements and options for conforming to it as a standard.
      User interface guidelines that are not intended for use as
      standards do not have such a structure. Readers more familiar
      with that latter form of user interface guideline are
      encouraged to read this specification as a way to avoid known
      mistakes in usable security.</p>

      <p>This specification comes with two companion documents:
      <a href="#ref-wsc-usecases">[WSC-USECASES]</a> documents the
      initial assumptions about the scope of this specification. It
      also includes an initial set of use cases the Working Group
      discussed. <a href="#ref-wsc-threats">[WSC-THREATS]</a>
      documents the Working Group's initial threat analysis. This
      document is based on current best practices in deployed user
      agents, and covers the use cases and threats in those
      documents to that extent.</p>

        <p>This specification assumes a human user interacting with
        a <a title="" href="#def-user-agent">Web user agent</a>,
        interacting with Web resources. Many of the requirements
        specified are focused on the presentation of security
        context information to the user, and therefore directly
        relate to user interfaces. Where requirements or techniques
        are specific to certain modalities, these are made
        explicit, and are part of the preconditions for applying
        the requirement or technique.</p>

        <p>When this specification speaks of a Web user agent to
        describe the application through which a user interacts
        with the Web, then this term is used on a conceptual level:
        No assumption is made about implementation details; the
        "Web user agent" may denote a combination of several
        applications, extensions to such applications, operating
        system features, and assistive technologies.</p>

        <p>A common user agent will therefore be a web browser with
        some number of plug-ins, extensions, call outs to external
        systems which render particular document formats, and
        assistive technologies.</p>

        <p>This specification makes no specific assumption about
        the content with which the user interacts, except for one:
        There is a top-level <a title="" href="#def-page">Web
        page</a> that is identified by a URI <a href=
        "#ref-URI">[RFC3986]</a>. This Web page might be an HTML
        frameset, an application running on top of a proprietary
        run-time environment, or a document in a format interpreted
        by plug-ins or external systems served as part of a Web
        interaction. The page's behavior might be determined by
        scripting, stylesheets, or other mechanisms.</p>

        <p>In interactive Web applications, the presentation to the
        user might also depend on state that is local to the client
        - be it local storage of structured data, or be it recent
        interactions with the Web page. The security properties of
        those data will depend on the security properties of the
        client computer itself, and are out of scope for this
        specification.</p>

        <p>Some requirements are expressed in terms of user
        interface components commonly found in current-generation
        <a title="" href="#def-user-agent">Web user agents</a>.</p>

        and Information</a></h3>

        <p>Public key certificates (see <a href=
        "#ref-PKIX">[PKIX]</a>) are widely used in TLS <a href=
        "#ref-sslv3">[SSLv3]</a> <a href="#ref-tlsv11">[TLSv11]</a>

        modifications to current certificate processing aimed at
        improving this aspect of handling web security context and
        defines some new terms describing various cases related to
        certificate handling in user agents.</p>

        <p>User agents can base their acceptance of certificates
        that are presented by Web servers on various sources,
        including user action, previous interactions involving the
        same certificate, or, as more traditionally assumed, on
        validation of a certificate chain where each certificate is
        issued by a Certification Authority (CA). The practices
        used by CAs (and the information attested) vary by CA and
        are not available in any useful sense to Web user
        agents.</p>

        <div class="div3">
          <h4><a href="#sec-interactively" id="sec-interactively"
          name="sec-interactively" class="anchor">5.1.1
          Interactively accepting trust anchors or
          certificates</a></h4>

          <p>A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity
          represented by a public key and associated data. The
          public key is used to verify digital signatures and the
          associated data is used to constrain the types of
          information for which the trust anchor is authoritative.
          Relying parties use trust anchors to determine if
          digitally signed information objects are valid by
          verifying digital signatures using the trust anchor's
          public key and by enforcing the constraints expressed in
          the associated certificate data.</p>

          <p>Trust anchor installation is typically handled by user
          agent vendors, systems administrators and device
          manufacturers, based on out-of-band information. Note
          that updating trust anchors is therefore often handled as
          part of user agent or operating system software
          updates.</p>

          <p>However, current user agents sometimes support the
          interactive acceptance of a trust anchor during a
          session, based on user interaction. Most users cannot
          sensibly decide how to handle such interactions.</p>

          <p>Similarly, end-entity (e.g. web server) certificates
          that cannot be currently verified using the Basic Path
          Validation algorithm may trigger current user agents to
          offer the user a choice to accept the certificate in any
          case, sometimes for a single session, sometimes for all
          future sessions involving that certificate, possibly
          scoped to specific host and port combinations.</p>

          <p>[<a name="def-interactively" id="def-interactively"
          title="">Definition</a>: A trust anchor or certificate is
          <b>interactively accepted</b> if the acceptance was
          caused through a user interaction that happens while the
          user is focused on a primary task unrelated to trust and
          certificate management.]</p>

          <p>For example, if a web server certificate is presented
          for acceptance by a user during ordinary Web
          interactions, and is accepted by the user, then this
          matches the test for interactive acceptance. If, however,
          a systems administrator (or user) adds a trust anchor's
          certificate to an agent's store of trust roots, then that
          certificate is not considered interactively accepted.</p>

          Certificates</a></h4>

          <p>Some trust anchors adhere to documented broadly
          accepted practices (e.g. <a href=
          "#ref-EV">[EVTLSCERT]</a>). These involve some level of
          guarantee that certificates chaining up to those roots
          embody augmented assurance and can therefore be treated
          more favorably in terms of the primary security
          indicators. We call such certificates "Augmented
          Assurance Certificates".</p>

          <p>[<a name="def-augmented-assurance-cert" id=
          "def-augmented-assurance-cert" title="">Definition</a>:
          An <b>Augmented Assurance Certificate</b> is a public key
          certificate where the issuer asserts that the subject
          entity has been authenticated by means of some process
          that adheres to the requirements of an augmented
          assurance specification supported by the user agent. The
          certificate chain for such a certificate MUST be
          validated up to a trust root that is recognized as
          augmented assurance qualified by the user agent.]</p>

          <p>This specification does not define what an "augmented
          assurance qualified trust root" is, except to note that
          this designation is made by user agents through an out of
          band mechanism consistent with the relevant underlying
          augmented assurance specification.</p>

          <p>Marking a trust anchor as augmented assurance
          qualified is a security-critical step and most often will
          involve the use of some application-specific out-of-band
          mechanism.</p>

          <p><span id="I">Implementations MUST NOT enable users to
          designate trust roots as augmented assurance qualified as
          part of a unrelated interaction.</span> In particular,
          the notions of an augmented assurance qualified trust
          root and an <a title="" href=
          "#def-interactively">interactively</a> accepted trust
          root are mutually exclusive.</p>

          <p>In addition to the out of band designation process
          described above, the trust anchor, and possibly all
          certificates in a path chaining up to such a trust anchor
          may need to be specially marked, e.g. through the use of
          specific policy object identifiers.</p>

          <p>The specific marking mechanisms to be used and the
          special treatment to be afforded to such certificates are
          out of scope of this document, but will typically be
          covered by the underlying augmented assurance
          specification. User agent implementers determine the set
          of such standards that they support and the associated
          special treatment to apply, other than as outlined below,
          where we impose some consistency requirements on the
          handling of this type of certificate.</p>

          <p><span id="II">To derive a human-readable subject name
          from an augmented assurance certificate, user agents
          SHOULD use the Subject field's Organization (O) and
          Country (C) attributes.</span> <span id="IIa">They MUST
          use information that is subject to the certificate
          authority's additional assurances, as documented in the
          user agent's conformance statement.</span></p>

          <p>Note: Should certificates arise in the future that
          provide strong assurance of the holder's identity, but do
          not include an organization attribute, then user agents
          can make use of the additional assurance level and
          identity information without violating this
          specification. Such future certificates could, for
          example, include high assurance certificates for
          individuals.</p>

          <p>The term [<a name="def-validated-cert" id=
          "def-validated-cert" title="">Definition</a>:
          <b>validated certificate</b> ] is used to denote a public
          key certificate that has been verified by chaining up to
          a locally configured trust anchor. The set of trust
          anchors used by a given Web User agent is
          implementation-dependent.</p>

          <p>Since Augmented Assurance Certificates chain up to a
          "special" trust anchor, all valid Augmented Assurance
          Certificates are also validated certificates.</p>

          <p>Certificates or certificate chains that are <a title=
          "" href="#def-pinned-cert">pinned</a> to a particular
          destination are <em>not</em> considered validated
          certificates by virtue of being pinned.</p>

          <p>The notion of a validated certificate in this
          specification corresponds to the domain validated
          certificate commonly deployed on the Web. This type of
          certificate attests to a binding between a domain name
          registration and a key pair; additional certificate
          attributes are often not validated.</p>

          Certificates and Untrusted Root Certificates</a></h4>

          <p>Self-signed certificates (SSC) which are not trust
          anchors by themselves are commonly used for appliances
          and web sites catering to small groups of users, and
          essentially serve as a container for cryptographic key
          material in a key exchange that is not verified by any
          third party. Certificate chains that lead up to custom
          root certificates which are not part of the user agent's
          store of trust roots are sometimes used similarly.</p>

          <p>In both situations, use of TLS provides
          confidentiality protection services against passive
          attackers. No binding of a third-party asserted identity
          to the cryptographic key is achieved. In both cases, the
          certificates are not considered <a title="" href=
          "#def-validated-cert">validated certificates</a>.</p>

          <p>Using Key Continuity Management <a href=
          "#ref-gutmann-kcm">[KCM]</a>, user agents can use
          self-signed certificates (or certificates that chain up
          to an untrusted root) to determine that they are
          consistently communicating with the same end entity,
          thereby defending against active attacks as well. Simply
          put, if a Web site consistently presents the same
          self-signed certificate (or the same certificate chaining
          up to the same untrusted root) to a client, then this can
          be strong evidence that protection against an active
          attacker has been achieved as well. Conversely, a change
          of certificates for the same site can be evidence that a
          man in the middle attack occurs -- or it can merely
          indicate that the legitimate site has changed to a
          different certificate.</p>

        the most relevant property of <a href=

        <em>first</em> TLS interaction with a site, even if that
        site uses validated or extended validation certificates: An
        active attacker can show a self-signed certificate, which
        will cause only weak warning signals to the user.
        Traditional user agents react to this scenario with a
        dialog box that interrupts the user's flow of interaction,
        but gives users the ability to override the security
        warning. Empirical evidence shows that this ability is
        typically exercised by users.</p>

        <p>Countermeasures against this threat include the prior
        designation of high-value sites, for which extended
        validation or validated certificates are required (causing
        a stronger warning signal during the attack scenario
        described above), and communication of certification and
        TLS expectations by a mechanism separate from HTTP, e.g.
        through authenticated DNS records.</p>

        <p>The TLS Errors (<a href="#sec-tlserrors"><b>5.4.1 TLS

        for user agents when a certificate status check fails for

        writing, the deployment environment for OCSP <a href=
        "#ref-ocsp">[RFC2560]</a> status checking is fragile and
        subject to frequent failures, so it is inappropriate to
        require that user agents treat such failures as warnings or
        errors. However, this creates a possibility for attack:
        site operators using a fraudulently obtained, and revoked,
        certificate may attempt to attack a CA's revocation
        infrastructure as a way to suppress revocation errors. User
        agent countermeasures for this vulnerability include:

        <p>While TLS certificates of all types (i.e. self-signed,

        strong encryption of communications, they should not be

        definitions) but they do not represent any guarantees that
        a site is operated in a safe manner, or is not otherwise
        subject to attack. Historically, issues of security and
        identity have been conflated by user agent interfaces which
        present SSL/TLS connections as "secure," but implementers

        <p>Several recommendations in this document concern

        certificates, but equally important for users is the
        binding between domain name/certificate and the actual
        real-world entity involved in the transaction. It is
        helpful, for example, to know not only that example.com
        presents a valid certificate, but also that it is the
        "Example Inc., Norway" with whom the user expects to be
        interacting. In the case of augmented assurance
        certificates, the identity information provided may be
        considered sufficient for this purpose, but other validated
        certificates do not necessarily provide this real-world
        identity. User agents that wish to provide a mechanism for

        of the messages and their ability to effectively interrupt

        <p>User agents are advised to constrain the number of
        warnings and errors presented to the minimum required to
        satisfy these and other security guidelines. It is also
        recommended that user agents phrase options in these

        Augmented Assurance and Validated Certificates</a></h3>

        <p>The Augmented Assurance indicator tells the user that
        the owner and author of the Web page being displayed can be
        identified using information from the associated augmented
        assurance certificate. Identity signals in this
        specification only directly address displaying the identity
        of the party responsible for the top level resource in a
        Web page. User agents may choose to make the identities of
        other resources that can affect or control the page's
        content available, but we do not put forward a model for
        users on how they might use such information in their trust
        decisions.</p>

        <p>The identity of the top level resource vouches for the
        content of all dependent resources. What resources these
        are is under the control of the top-level resource, which
        will typically identify these resources using URIs with
        domain based authority. Therefore, this specification
        requires that, in order to display any augmented assurance
        related indicators, dependent resources must all be
        strongly TLS protected <em>using validated
        certificates</em>.</p>

        <p>If an augmented assurance page includes content from
        other strongly TLS-protected resources that are not
        identified by augmented assurance certificates, the authors
        for these third party parts of the document cannot be
        identified to the same extent as for the main document.
        Given that certain types of content, for example external
        scripts and styling can change the containing document's
        entire appearance, and framed content and plug-ins can be
        where the user's main interaction occurs, the user's real
        interaction may be with content under the control of a
        completely different party than the one identified by the
        main document's augmented assurance certificate.</p>

        <p>Using third party content also makes the main document
        reliant upon the security of the third party contributor,
        and expands the available attack surface of the service,
        thus giving attackers several more lines of attack.</p>

        <p>Under the agent's Same Origin policy, separately
        displayed Web pages from the same origin can freely read
        and modify each other's state. A Web page's origin is
        comprised of the scheme, host and port of the URI used to
        retrieve the Web page. The origin does not take into
        account any attributes of the TLS session or server
        certificate used when retrieving a Web page. For example,
        consider a user agent that has loaded two Web pages from
        "https://www.example.com/". When the first page was
        retrieved, an Augmented Assurance Certificate was used by
        the TLS session. When the second page was retrieved, a
        different certificate, such as a domain validated or
        self-signed certificate, was used. Though the first page
        was retrieved using an augmented assurance certificate, the
        second page can freely read and write the first page.
        Differing security presentations of the two pages may
        obscure this relationship in the mind of the user.</p>

        well be that a page that was retrieved from a secure Web
        site with an Augmented Assurance certificate could at some

        "#ref-XHRl2">[XHR2]</a>, this specification permits either
        handling the error situation described above as a network
        error (and leaving behavior to the Web application in
        question) or causing a user interaction. It is expected
        that upcoming specifications for the XMLHttpRequest API
        will opt for the former choice.</p>
