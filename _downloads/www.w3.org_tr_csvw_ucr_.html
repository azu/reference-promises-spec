      <p> A large percentage of the data published on the Web is tabular data, commonly published as
        comma separated values (CSV) files. The CSV on the Web Working Group aim to specify
        technologies that provide greater interoperability for data dependent applications on the
        Web when working with tabular datasets comprising single or multiple files using CSV, or
        similar, format. </p>
      <p> This document lists the use cases compiled by the Working Group that are considered
        representative of how tabular data is commonly used within data dependent applications. The
        use cases observe existing common practice undertaken when working with tabular data, often
        illustrating shortcomings or limitations of existing formats or technologies. This document
        also provides a set of requirements derived from these use cases that have been used to
        guide the specification design. </p>

      <p> A large percentage of the data published on the Web is tabular data, commonly published as
        comma separated values (CSV) files. CSV files may be of a significant size but they can be
        generated and manipulated easily, and there is a significant body of software available to
        handle them. Indeed, popular spreadsheet applications (Microsoft Excel, iWork’s Number, or
        OpenOffice.org) as well as numerous other applications can produce and consume these files.
        However, although these tools make conversion to CSV easy, it is resisted by some publishers
        because CSV is a much less rich format that can't express important detail that the
        publishers want to express, such as annotations, the meaning of identifier codes etc. </p>
      <p> Existing formats for tabular data are format-oriented and hard to process (e.g. Excel);
        un-extensible (e.g. CSV/TSV); or they assume the use of particular technologies (e.g. SQL
        dumps). None of these formats allow developers to pull in multiple data sets, manipulate,
        visualize and combine them in flexible ways. Other information relevant to these datasets,
        such as access rights and provenance, is not easy to find. CSV is a very useful and simple
        format, but to unlock the data and make it portable to environments other than the one in
        which it was created, there needs to be a means of encoding and associating relevant
        metadata. </p>
      <p> To address these issues, the CSV on the Web Working Group seeks to provide: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Metadata vocabulary for CSV data</li>
        <li>Access methods for CSV Metadata</li>
        <li>Mapping mechanism to transforming CSV into various Formats (e.g., RDF [<cite><a href="#bib-rdf11-concepts" class="bibref">rdf11-concepts</a></cite>], JSON [<cite><a href="#bib-json" class="bibref">json</a></cite>], or
          XML [<cite><a href="#bib-xml" class="bibref">xml</a></cite>])</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In order to determine the scope of and elicit the requirements for this <i>extended</i>
        CSV format (CSV+) a set of use cases have been compiled. Each use case provides a narrative
        describing how a representative user works with tabular data to achieve their goal,
        supported, where possible, with example datasets. The use cases observe existing common
        practice undertaken when working with tabular data, often illustrating shortcomings or
        limitations of existing formats or technologies. It is anticipated that the additional
        metadata provided within the CSV+ format, when coupled with metadata-aware tools, will
        simplify how users work with tabular data. As a result, the use cases seek to identify where
        user effort may be reduced. </p>
      <p> A set of requirements, used to guide the development of the CSV+ specification, have been
        derived from the compiled use cases. </p>

      <!--OddPage--><h2 id="h2_uc" role="heading" aria-level="1"><span class="secno">2. </span>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>The use cases below describe many applications of tabular data. Whilst there are many
        different variations of tabular data, all the examples conform to the definition of 
        tabular data defined in the Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web [<cite><a href="#bib-tabular-data-model" class="bibref">tabular-data-model</a></cite>]:</p>
      <p><em><strong>Tabular data</strong> is data that is structured into rows, each of which 
        contains information about some thing. Each row contains the same number of fields 
        (although some of these fields may be empty), which provide values of properties of 
        the thing described by the row. In tabular data, fields within the same column provide 
        values for the same property of the thing described by the particular row.</em></p>
      <p>In selecting the use cases we have reviewed a number of <em>row oriented</em> data
        formats that, at first glance, appear to be tabular data. However, closer inspection
        indicates that one or other of the characteristics of tabular data were not present. 
        For example, the <a href="http://www.interfaceware.com/blog/understanding-hl7-messages/">HL7 format</a>, 
        from the health informatics domain defines a separate schema for each row (known as
        a "segment" in that format) which means that HL7 messages do not have a regular
        number of columns for each row.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The laws of England and Wales place obligations upon departments and <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">The National Archives</a> for the collection,
          disposal and preservation of records. Government departments are obliged within the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/legislation/public-records-act/">Public Records Act 1958</a> sections 3, 4 and 5 to select, transfer, preserve and make
          available those records that have been defined as public records. These obligations apply
          to records in all formats and media, including paper and digital records. Details
          concerning the selection and transfer of records can be found <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/selection-and-transfer/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Departments transferring records to TNA must catalogue or list the selected records
          according to The National Archives' defined cataloguing principles and standards.
          Cataloguing is the process of writing a description, or <em>Transcriptions of Records</em>
          for the records being transferred. Once each Transcription of Records is added to the
          Records Catalogue, records can be subsequently discovered and accessed using the supplied
          descriptions and titles.</p>
        <p>TNA specifies what information should be provided within a Transcriptions of Records and
          how that information should be formatted. A number of formats and syntaxes are supported,
          including RDF. However, the predominant format used for the exchange of Transcriptions of
          Records is CSV as the government departments providing the Records lack either the
          technology or resources to provide metadata in the XML and RDF formats preferred by the
          TNA.</p>
        <p>A CSV-encoded Transcriptions of Records typically describes a set of Records, often
          organised within a hierarchy. As a result, it is necessary to describe the
          interrelationships between Records within a single CSV file.</p>
        <p>Each row within a CSV file relates to a particular Record and is allocated a unique
          identifier. This unique identifier behaves as a primary key for the Record within the
          scope of the CSV file and is used when referencing that Record from within other Record
          transcriptions. The unique identifier is unique within the scope of the datafile; in 
          order for the Record to be referenced from outside this datafile, the local identifier
          must be mapped to a globally unique identifier such as a URI.</p>

          <a href="#R-ForeignKeyReferences">ForeignKeyReferences</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Upon receipt by TNA, each of the Transcriptions of Records is validated against the (set
          of) centrally published data definition(s); it is essential that received CSV metadata
          comply with these specifications to ensure efficient and error free ingest into the
          Records Catalogue.</p>
        <p>The validation applied is dependent the type of entity described in each row. Entity type
          is specified in a specific column (e.g. <code>type</code>).</p>
        <p>The data definition file, or CSV Schema, used by the CSV Validation Tool effectively
          forms the basis of a formal contract between TNA and supplying organisations. For more
          information on the CSV Validation Tool and CSV Schema developed by TNA please refer to the
            <a href="https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-validator#csv-validator">online
            documentation</a>. </p>
        <p>The CSV Validation Tool is written in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>

          <a href="#R-CsvValidation">CsvValidation</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Following validation, the CSV-encoded Transcriptions of Records are transformed into RDF
          for insertion into the triple store that underpins the Records Catalogue. The CSV is initially
          <a href="https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-tools/blob/master/csv-to-xml_v3.xsl">
          transformed into an interim XML format using XSLT</a> and then processed further using a mix
          of XSLT, Java and Scala to create RDF/XML. The CSV files do
          not include all the information required to undertake the transformation, e.g. defining
          which RDF properties are to be used when creating triples for the data value in each cell.
          As a result, bespoke software has been created by TNA to supply the necessary additional
          information during the CSV to RDF transformation process. The availability of generic
          mechanisms to transform CSV to RDF would reduce the burden of effort within TNA when
          working with CSV files.</p>

        <p>
          In this particular case, RDF is the target format for the conversiono f the CSV-encoded
          Transcriptions of Records. However, the conversion of CSV to XML (in this case used as 
          an interim conversion step) is illustrative of a common data conversion workflow.</p>
        <p>
          The transformation outlined above is typical of common practice in that it uses a

        <p>The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) is the UK’s
          largest independent producer of official statistics and is the recognised national
          statistical institute for the UK. It is responsible for collecting and publishing
          statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local
          levels.</p>
        <p>Sets of statistics are typically grouped together into datasets comprising of collections of 
          related tabular data. Within their underlying information systems, ONS maintains a clear 
          separation between the statistical data itself and the metadata required for interpretation. 
          ONS classify the metadata into two categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>structural metadata</strong>: dimensionality, sort order, axis metadata, axis ordering etc.</li>
          <li><strong>reference metadata</strong>: linked descriptive information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These datasets are published on-line in both CSV format and as Microsoft
          Excel Workbooks that have been manually assembled from the underlying data.</p>
        <p>For example, refer to dataset <strong>QS601EW Economic activity</strong>, derived from the 
          2011 Census, is available as a precompiled Microsoft Excel Workbook for several sets of 
          administrative geographies, e.g. <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs601ew.xls">

        <p>The ONS Data Explorer presents the user with a list of available datasets. A user may choose
          to browse through the entire list or filter that list by topic. To enable the user to determine
          whether or not a dataset meets their need, summary information is available for each dataset.</p>

          databank</h3>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Jeremy Tandy)</span>
        </p>
        <p> Climate change and global warming have become one of the most pressing environmental
          concerns in society today. Crucial to predicting future change is an understanding of how
          the world’s historical climate, with long duration instrumental records of climate being
          central to that goal. Whilst there is an abundance of data recording the climate at
          locations the world over, the scrutiny under which climate science is put means that much
          of this data remains unused leading to a paucity of data in some regions with which to
          verify our understanding of climate change.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.surfacetemperatures.org/home">International Surface Temperature
            Initiative</a> seeks to create a consolidated global land surface temperatures databank
          as an open and freely available resource to climate scientists.</p>

        <p>To achieve this goal, climate datasets, known as “decks”, are gathered from participating
          organisations and merged into a combined dataset using a scientifically peer reviewed <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage3/merging_methodology.pdf"> method</a> which assesses the data records for inclusion against a variety of
          criteria.</p>

        <p>Given the need for openness and transparency in creating the databank, it is essential
          that the provenance of the source data is clear. Original source data, particularly for
          records captured prior to the mid-twentieth century, may be in hard-copy form. In order to
          incorporate the widest possible scope of source data, the International Surface
          Temperature Initiative is supported by <a href="http://www.surfacetemperatures.org/databank/data-rescue-task-team">data rescue
            activities</a> to digitise hard copy records.</p>

        <p>The data is, where possible, published in the following four stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stage 0: raw digital image of hard copy records or information as to hard copy
            location</li>
          <li>Stage 1: data in native format provided</li>
          <li>Stage 2: data converted into a common format and with provenance and version control
            information appended</li>
          <li>Stage 3: merged collation of stage 2 data within a single consolidated dataset</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Stage 1 data is typically provided in tabular form - the most common variant is
          white-space delimited ASCII files. Each data deck comprises multiple files which are
          packaged as a compressed tar ball (<code>.tar.gz</code>). Included within the compressed
          tar ball package, and provided alongside, is a read-me file providing unstructured
          supplementary information. Summary information is often embedded at the top of each
          file.</p>

        <p>For example, see the <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage1/uganda/uganda.monthly.stage1.20140224.tar.gz"> Ugandan Stage 1 data deck</a> (<a href="uganda.monthly.stage1.20140224.tar.gz">local copy</a>) and associated <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage1/uganda/1-readme-uganda-monthly.txt"> readme file</a> (<a href="1-readme-uganda-monthly.txt">local copy</a>).</p>

        <p>The Ugandan Stage 1 data deck appears to be comprised of two discrete datasets, each
          partitioned into a sub-directory within the tar ball: <code>uganda-raw</code> and
            <code>uganda-bestguess</code>. Each sub-directory includes a Microsoft Word document
          providing supplementary information about the provenance of the dataset; of particular
          note is that <code>uganda-raw</code> is collated from 9 source datasets whilst
            <code>uganda-bestguess</code> provides what is considered by the data publisher to be
          the best set of values with duplicate values discarded.</p>

        </p>

        <p>Dataset <code>uganda-raw</code> is split into 96 discrete files, each providing maximum,
          minimum or mean monthly air temperature for one of the 32 weather observation stations
          (sites) included in the data set. Similarly, dataset <code>uganda-bestguess</code> is
          partitioned into discrete files; this case just 3 files each of which provide maximum,
          minimum or mean monthly air temperature data for all sites. The mapping from data file to
          data sub-set is described in the Microsoft Word document.</p>

        <p>The key characteristics are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>white space delimited; this is not strictly a CSV file</li>
          <li>summary information pertinent to the “data rows” is included at the beginning of the
            data file</li>
          <li>row, column and cell value interpretation is informed by accompanying Microsoft Word
            document; human intervention is required to unambiguously determine semantics, e.g. the
            meaning of each column, the unit of measurement</li>
          <li>the observed property is defined as “Tmax”; there is no reference to an authoritative
            definition describing that property</li>
          <li>there is no header line providing column names </li>
          <li>the year and month (column 1) is expressed as a decimal value; e.g. 1901.04 –
            equivalent to January, 1901</li>
          <li>multiple temperature values (“replicates”) are provided for each row; one from each of
            the sources defined in the header, e.g. <code>BEA</code> (British East Africa),
              <code>GHCNv3G</code>, <code>ColArchive</code>, <code>GSOD</code> and
              <code>NCARds512</code></li>
          <li>the provenance of specific cell values cannot be asserted; for example, data values
            for 1935 observed at Entebbe are digitised from <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage0/uganda/Uganda_1935-1938.pdf#page=3">digital images published in PDF</a> (<a href="Uganda_1935-1938.pdf#page=3">local copy</a>)</li>

        <p>Many of the characteristics concerning the “raw” file are exhibited here too.
          Additionally, we see that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the delimiter is now tab (<code>U+0009</code>)</li>
          <li>metadata is entirely missing from this file, requiring human intervention to combine
            the filename token (<code>tmx</code>) with supplementary information in the accompanying
            Microsoft Word document to determine the semantics</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At present, the global surface temperature databank comprises 25 Stage 1 data decks for
          monthly temperature observations. These are provided by numerous organisations in
          heterogeneous forms. In order to merge these data decks into a single combined dataset,
          each data deck has to be converted into a standard form. Columns consist of: <code>station
            name</code>, <code>latitude</code>, <code>longitude</code>, <code>altitude</code>,
            <code>date</code>, <code>maximum monthly temperature</code>, <code>minimum monthly
            temperature</code>, <code>mean monthly temperature</code> plus additional provenance
          information.</p>

        <p>Because of the heterogeneity of the Stage 1 data decks, bespoke data processing programs
          were required for each data deck consuming valuable effort and resource in simple data
          pre-processing. If the semantics, structure and other supplementary metadata pertinent to
          the Stage 1 data decks had been machine readable, then this data homogenisation stage
          could have been avoided altogether. Data provenance is crucial to this initiative,
          therefore it would be beneficial to be able to associate the supplementary metadata
          without needing to edit the original data files.</p>

        <p>The data pre-processing tools created to parse each Stage 1 data deck into the standard
          Stage 2 format and the merge process to create the consolidated Stage 3 data set were
          written using the software most familiar to the participating scientists: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran_95_language_features">Fortran 95</a>. The
          merge software source code is available <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage3/recommended/code/recommended.code.v1.0.0-beta4.20130614.tar.gz">online</a>. It is worth noting that this sector of the scientific community also
          commonly uses <a href="http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx">IDL</a> and is
          gradually adopting <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> as the default software
          language choice. </p>

        <p>The resulting merged dataset is published in several formats – including tabular text.
          The <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage3/recommended/results/recommended-ghcn_format.monthly.stage3.v1.0.0-beta4.20130614.tar.gz"> GHCN-format merged dataset</a> comprises of several files: merged data and withheld
          data (e.g. those data that did not meet the merge criteria) each with an associated
          “inventory” file.</p>

        <p>A snippet of the inventory for merged data is provided below; each row describing one of

        <p>The columns are: <code>station identifier</code>, <code>latitude</code>,

          data is fixed format rather than delimited.</p>

        <p>Similarly, a snippet of the merged data itself is provided. Given that the original
            <code>.dat</code> file is a largely unmanageable 422.6 MB in size, a subset is provided.

        <p>The resulting merged dataset provides time series of how the observed climate has changed 
          over a long duration at approximately 32000 locations around the globe. Such instrumental
          climate records provide a basis for climate research. However, it is well known that these
          climate records are usually affected by inhomogeneities (artifical shifts) due to changes
          in the measurement conditions (e.g. relocation, modification or recalibration
          of the instrument etc.). As these artificial shifts often have the same magnitude as the
          climate signal, such as long-term variations, trends or cycles, a direct analysis of the
          raw time-series data can lead to wrong conclusions about climate change.</p>
        <p>Statistical homogenisation procedures are used to detect and correct these artificial shifts. 
          Once detected, the raw time-series data is annotated to indicate the presence of artifical
          shifts in the data, details of the homogenisation procedure undertaken and, where possible, 
          the reasons for those shifts.</p>

        <p>Each row, or record, within the tabular dataset describes a property transaction. The 
          <code>Transaction unique identifier</code> column provides a unique identifier for that
          property transaction. Given that transactions may be amended, this identifier cannot
          be treated as a primary key for rows within the dataset as the identifier may occur
          more than once. the primary key for each record. In order for the 
          property transaction to be referenced from outside this dataset, the local identifier
          must be mapped to a globally unique identifier such as a URI.</p>

          geographic descriptors are commonly used. Whilst there is no attempt to 
          link these descriptors to specific geographic identifiers, such a linkage is likely
          to provide additional utility when aggregating transaction data by location or region for further
          analysis. At present there is no standardised mechanism to associate the catagory codes,
          provided as plain text, or geographic identifiers with their authoritative definitions.</p>

        <p>The collated monthly transaction dataset is used as the basis for updating the Land Registry's 
          information systems; in this case the data is persisted as RDF triples within a triple store. 
          A <a href="http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/landregistry/sparql/sparql.html">SPARQL end-point</a>
          and accompanying <a href="http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/def/ppi">data definitions</a> are provided 
          by the Land Registry allowing users to query the content of the triple store.</p>
        
        <p>In order to update the triple store, the monthly transaction dataset is converted into RDF. The 
          value of the <code>Record status</code> cell for a given row informs the update process: add, update or
          delete. Bespoke software has been created by the Land Registry to transformation from CSV to RDF.
          The transformation requires supplementary information not present in the CSV, such as the RDF 
          properties for each column specified in the <a href="http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/def/ppi">
          data definitions</a>. The need to create and maintain bespoke software incurs costs that may 
          be avoided through use of a generic CSV-to-RDF transformation mechanism. </p>

          Given that the complete dataset is approaching 3GB in size, the annual partitions provide a
          far more manageable method to download the property transaction data. However, each annual 
          partition is only a subset of the complete dataset. It is important to be able to both make
          assertions about the complete dataset (e.g. publication date, license etc.) and to be 
          able to understand how an annual partition relates to the complete dataset and other partitions.</p>

        <p> When performing literature searches researchers need to retain a persisted collection of
            journal articles of interest in a local database compiled from on-line publication websites.  
            In this use case a researcher wants to retain a local personal journal article publication 
            database based on the search results from <a href="http://www.plosone.org//">Public Library 
            of Science</a>. PLOS One is a nonprofit open access scientific publishing project aimed at creating 
            a library of open access journals and other scientific literature under an open content license.  
          </p>
          <p>
          In general this use case also illustrates the utility of CSV as a convenient exchange format for pushing
          tabular data between software components: 
          </p> 
          <ul>
          <li> making it easier to interpret the data on subsequent ingest
          </li>
          <li> being able to work with manageable chunks of a tabular data set (e.g. only subsets of the tabular dataset 
               are ever materialised in a single CSV file, and we often want to know how that subset fits within the larger 
               whole).
          </li>
          </ul>
    
       <p> The PLOS website features a <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> index search 
           engine (Live Search) which can return query results in  
         <a href="http://api.plos.org/search/?q=doc_type:full+AND+cross_published_journal_key:PLoSONE&amp;fl=id,doi,publication_date,title_display,author&amp;sort=publication_date+desc&amp;rows=5">XML</a>,

          <p>Other common methods of splitting up large datasets into manageable chunks include
          partitioning by time (e.g. all the records added to a dataset in a given day may be
          exported in a CSV file). Such partitioning allows regular updates to be shared. However, 
          in order to recombine those time-based partitions into the complete set, one needs to know
          the datetime range for which that dataset partition is valid. Such information should be
          available within a CSV metadata description.</p>

        To be useful to a user maintaining a PLOS One search results need to be returned in an organized and
        consistent tabular format.  This includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> mapping search critiera cells to columns returned in the search results 
        </li>
        <li> ordering the columns to match the order of the search criteria cells.
        </li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Lastly because the researcher may use different search criteria the header row plays an important role
        later for the researcher wanting to combine multiple literature searches into their database.
        The researcher will use the header column names returned in the first row as a way to identify
        each column type.

        <p>Search results returned in a tabular format can contain cell values that organized in data structures
        also known as micro formats. In example above the publication_date and authors list represent two 
        micro formats that are represented in a recognizable pattern that can be parsed by software or 
        by the human reader. In the case of the author column, microformats provide the advantage of being
        able to store a single author's name or multiple authors names separated by a comma delimiter.
        Because each author cell value is surrounded by quotes a parser can choose to ignore the
        data structure or address it.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, note that the values of the <code>title_display</code> column contain markup. Whilst 
        these values may be treated as pure text, it provides an example of how structure or

        </p>
	<p>Several Web sources expose datasets about UK crime statistics.
	These datasets vary in format (e.g. maps vs. CSV files), timeliness, aggregation level, etc.
	Before being published on the Web, these data are processed to preserve the privacy of the people
	involved, but again the processing policy varies from source to source.</p>
	<p>Every month, the UK Police Home Office publishes (via <a href="http://data.police.uk/">data.police.uk</a>) CSV files that report crime
	counts, aggregated on geographical basis (per address or police neighbourhood) and on type basis.
	Before publishing, data are smoothed, that is, grouped in predefined areas and assigned to the
	mid point of each area. Each area has to contain a minimum number of physical addresses. The goal
	of this procedure is to prevent the reconstruction of the identity of the people involved in the
	crimes.</p>
	<p>Over time, the policies adopted for preprocessing these data have changed, but data previously
	published have not been recomputed. Therefore, datasets about different months present relevant
	differences in terms of crime types reported and geographical aggregation (e.g. initially, each
	geographical area for aggregation had to include at least 12 physical addresses. Later, this
	limit was lowered to 8).</p>
	<p>These policies introduce a controlled error in the data for privacy reasons, but these changes
	in the policies imply the fact that different datasets adhere differently to the real data, i.e.
	they present different reliability levels. <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1073/pospaper2.pdf">Previous work</a> provided two procedures for measuring
	and comparing the reliability of the datasets, but in order to automate and improve these procedures,
	it is crucial to understand the meaning of the columns, the relationships between columns, and how the
	data rows have been computed.</p>
	<p>For instance, here is a snippet from a dataset about crime happened in Hampshire in April 2012:</p>
	<div class="example"><div class="example-title"><span>Example 12</span></div><pre class="example">Month,	Force,			Neighbourhood,	Burglary,	Robbery,	Vehicle crime,	Violent crime,	Anti-social behaviour,	Other crime

2011-04	Hampshire Constabulary,	2LE12,		3,		0,		0,		4,		25,			21
{snip}</pre></div>
	<p>and that dataset reports 248 entries, while in October 2012, the crime types we can see are increased to 11:</p>
	<div class="example"><div class="example-title"><span>Example 13</span></div><pre class="example">Month,	Force,			Neighbourhood,	Burglary,	Robbery,	Vehicle crime,	Violent crime,	Anti-social behaviour,	Criminal damage and arson,	Shoplifting,	Other theft,	Drugs,	Public disorder and weapons,	Other crime
{snip}

2012-10,Hampshire Constabulary,	1SY02,		11,		0,		11,		20,		144,			39,				2,		12,		9,	8,				5
  {snip}</pre></div>
	<p>This dataset reports 232 entries.</p>
	
	<p>In order to properly handle the columns,
	it is crucial to understand the type of the data contained therein. Given the context, knowing
	this information would reveal an important part of the column meaning (e.g. to identify dates).

        </p>
	<p>
	Also, it is important to understand the precise semantics of each column.
	This is relevant for two reasons. First, to identify relations between columns (e.g. some crime types
	are siblings, while other are less semantically related). Second, to identify semantic relations between
	columns in heterogeneous datasets (e.g. a column in one dataset may correspond to the sum of two or more
	columns in others).

        </p>
	<p>A <a href="http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v13/n12/full/ni.2449.html#supplementary-information">paper</a> published
	in Nature Immunology in December 2012 compared changes in expression of a range of genes in
	response to treatment with two different cytokines. The results were published in the paper as graphic figures,
	and the raw data was presented in the form of <a href="http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v13/n12/extref/ni.2449-S3.xls">
	supplementary spreadsheets, as Excel files</a> (<a href="ni.2449-S3.xls">local copy</a>).</p>

	<p>Having at disposal both the paper and the results, a scientist may wish to reproduce the experiment, check if the results
	he obtains coincide with those published, and compare those results with others, provided by different studies about the same
	issues.
	</p>
	<p>
	Because of the size of the datasets and of the complexity of the computations, it could be necessary to perform such
	analyses and comparisons by means of properly defined software, typically by means of an R, Python or Matlab script.
	Such software would require as input the data contained in the
	Excel file. However, it would be difficult to write a parser to extract the information, for the reasons described below.
	</p>
	<p>
	To clarify the issues related to the spreadsheet parsing and analysis, we first present an example extrapolated from it.
  The example below shows a CSV encoding of the original Excel speadsheet converted using Mircosoft Excel 2007. White space
  has been added to aid clarity. (file = <a href="ni.2449-S3.csv">ni.2449-S3.csv</a>)

	      <p>As we can see from the example, the table contains several columns of data that are measurements of gene expression in cells after
	      treatment with two concentrations of two cytokines, measured after two periods of time, presented as both actual values and fold
	      change. This can be represented in a table, but needs 3 levels of headings and several merged cells. In fact, the first row is the title of the table,
	      the second to fourth rows are the table headers.</p>
        <p>We also see that the first column <code>gene_name</code> provides a unique identifier for 
        the gene described in each row, with the second column <code>symbol</code> providing a
        human readable notation for each gene - albeit a scientific human! It is necessary to 
        determine which column, if any, provides the unique identifier for the entity which 
        each row describes. In order for the gene to be referenced from outside the datafile, 
        e.g. to reconcile the information in this table with other information about the gene,
        the local identifier must be mapped to a globally unique identifier such as a URI.</p>

	</p>
	
	
	<p>The first column contains a GenBank identifier for each gene, with the column name "gene_name". The GenBank identifier
	provides a local identifier for each gene. This local identifier, e.g. “NM_008638”, can be converted to a fully qualified URI by
	adding a URI prefix, e.g. “http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_008638” allowing the gene to be uniquely and unambiguously identified.</p>
	<p>The second column contains the standard symbol for each gene, labelled as "symbol".
	These appear to be HUGO gene nomenclature symbols, but as there's no mapping it's hard to be sure which namespace these symbols
	are from.</p>

	<p>As this spreadsheet was published as supplemental data for a journal article, there is little description
	of what the columns represent, even as text. There is a column labelled as "Cont", which has no description anywhere, but is
	presumably the background level of expression for each gene.</p>

	<p>Half of the cells represent measurements, but the details of what those measurements are can only be found
	in the article text. The other half of the cells represent the change in expression over the background level. It is difficult to
	tell the difference without annotation that describes the relationship between the cells (or understanding of the nested headings).
	In this particular spreadsheet, only the values are published, and not the formulae that were used to calculate the derived values.
	The units of each cell are "expression levels relative to the expression level of a constant gene, Rpl7", described in the text of
	the methods section of the full article.</p>

	4 hours).</p>
	<p>All the details of the experiment (which cells were used, how they were treated, when they were
	measured) are described in the methods section of the article. To be able to compare data between multiple experiments, a parser
	would also need to be able to understand all these parameters that may have affected the outcome of the experiment.</p>

         <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Mathew Thomas)</span>
        </p>
         <p> Chemical imaging experimental work makes use of CSV formats to record its measurements.  In this use 
            case two examples are shown to depict scans from a mass spectrometer and corresponding FTIR corrected files
            that are saved into a CSV format automatically.
          </p>
          <p> Mass Spectrometric Imaging (MSI) allows the generation of 2D ion density maps that help visualize 
              molecules present in sections of tissues and cells. The combination of spatial resolution and mass 
              resolution results in very large and complex data sets. The following is generated using the software 
              Decon Tools, a tool to de-isotope MS spectra and to detect features from MS data using isotopic signatures 
              of expected compounds, available freely at omins.pnnl.gov. The raw files generated by the mass spec 
              instrument are read in and the processed output files are saved as CSV files for each line.
          </p>
          <p> Fourier transform (FTIR) spectroscopy is a measurement technique whereby spectra are collected based on measurements 
              of the coherence of a radiative source, using time-domain or space-domain measurements of the electromagnetic 
              radiation or other type of radiation.
          </p>
          <p>
          In general this use case also illustrates the utility of CSV as a means for scientists to collect and process
          their experimental results: 
          </p> 
          <ul>
          <li> making it easier for data to be loaded into a spreadsheet to examine results
          </li>
          <li> being able to edit or select a portion of results to be plotted
          </li>
          <li> making it possible to combine all scans to examine full 2D composite image.
          </li> 
          </ul>
      <p> 
        The key characteristics are:  
        </p><ul>
        <li> CSV uses fixed number of cells
        </li>
        <li> First row provides header cell tags, although the FTIR header begins with a comma
        </li>
        <li> All values are comma separated, but they can be delimited by tabs as well.
        </li>
        <li> Because the data is being collected from an instrument some of the columns 
             represent measurement values taken during the experiment.
        </li>
        <li> Left column is typically regarded as the row primary key.

		<p>The <a href="http://datahub.io/organization/openspending">OpenSpending</a> and the <a href="http://datahub.io/organization/budgit">Budgit</a> platforms
		provide plenty of useful datasets providing figures of national budget and spending of several countries. A journalist willing to investigate
		about public spending fallacies can use these data as a basis for his research, and possibly compare them against different sources.
		Similarly, a politician that is interested in developing new policies for development can, for instance, combine these data with those from the
		<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> to identify correlations and, possibly, dependencies to leverage.
		</p>
		<p>
		Nevertheless, these uses of these datasets are possibly undermined by the following obstacles.
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><p>There are whole collections of datasets where a single currency is implied for all amounts given. See, for example, how all
		  <a href="http://datahub.io/dataset/si-budgets">Slovenian Budget Datasets</a> are implicitly give amounts in Euros. Given that Slovenia joined the Eurozone in 2007,
		  the currency in has changed relatively recently. How do we know if a given table expresses currency amounts in “tolar” or “Euro”?</p>
		  <p>In order to be able to compare and combine these data with those provided by other sources like the
		  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/country/uganda">World Bank</a>,
		  in an automatic manner, it would be necessary to explicitly define the currency of each column. Given that 
		  the currency will be uniform for a specific table, the currency metadata may be indicated once for the entire table.</p>

		  where there are four columns related to the amount. Of these, "amount" (Ugandan Shillings implied)
		  and "amount_dollars" (USD implied) are mandatory. The value of these columns is implicit, and moreover, as explained in the
		  <a href="http://datahub.io/dataset/ugandabudget">complementary information</a>, the Ugandan Shillings amount is computed by converting
		  the Dollars amount using a ratio determined on year basis (e.g. 2003/4: 1 USD = 1.847 UGX). Since this ratio varies on year basis,
		  and still corresponds to an approximation of the yearly value of the exchange rate, in order to properly use these data, it would

		  that row are reported.
		  Otherwise, the corresponding values are set to "0", to indicate that the row does not represent a donation and that the only relevant amounts for that row

       <p> 
        Google Fusion allows a user to download the tree data either from a filtered view or the entire spreadsheet.
        The exported spreadsheet is organized and consistent tabular format.  This includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> mapping spreadsheet cells to columns in the CSV file. 
        </li>
        <li> ordering the CSV columns to match the order of the spreadsheet columns.
        </li> 
        <li> The CSV file provides a primary key for each row (column <code>GID</code>), a unique identifier 
             for each tree (column <code>Tree ID</code>), accounts for missing data, and lists characteristics
             describing the condition of the tree in the comments cell using a micro syntax to delimit the
             characteristics list.  The spreadsheet also provides geo coordinate information pinpointing each

          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Eric Stephan)</span>
        </p>
         <p> The purpose of this use case is to illustrate how 3-D molecular structures such as the Protein Data Bank and 
             XYZ formats are conveyed in tabular formats.  These files be archived to be used informatics analysis or as part 
             of an input deck to be used in experimental simulation.  Scientific communities rely heavily on tabular formats such
             as these to conduct their research and share each others results in platform independent formats.   
          </p>
          <p> The Protein Data Bank (pdb) file format is a tabular file describing the three dimensional structures of molecules 
              held in the Protein Data Bank. The pdb format accordingly provides for description and annotation of protein and 
              nucleic acid structures including atomic coordinates, observed sidechain rotamers, secondary structure assignments, 
              as well as atomic connectivity.
          </p>
          <p> The XYZ file format is a chemical file format. There is no formal standard and several variations exist, but a typical 
              XYZ format specifies the molecule geometry by giving the number of atoms with Cartesian coordinates that will be read 
              on the first line, a comment on the second, and the lines of atomic coordinates in the following lines.
          </p>
          <p>
          In general this use case also illustrates the utility of CSV as a means for scientists to collect and process
          their experimental results: 
          </p> 
          <ul>
          <li> making it easier for data to be loaded into a spreadsheet to examine results
          </li>
          <li> being able to edit or select a portion of results to be plotted
          </li>
          <li> making it possible to combine all scans to examine full 2D composite image.
          </li> 
          </ul>
          <p></p>
      <p> 
        The key characteristics of the XYZ format are:  
        </p><ul>
        <li> CSV contains two header rows, the first row containing the number of atoms in molecule (number of rows in data block).
             The second is a comment line.</li>
        <li> Each row in the data block used a fix number of cells (atom name followed by x, y, z coordinates).</li>
        <li> All values are delimited by spaces.</li>
        </ul>

      <p> 
        The key characteristics of the PDB format are:  
        </p><ul>
        <li> Each PDB record is self describing and contains different ways to document each protein. 
        </li>
        <li> Each row of the file uses a token to depict the purpose of that row.
        </li>
        <li> Tabular data rows varies fixed number of columns (e.g. ATOM) to non-fixed number of columns (SEQRES) 
             that specify the number of columns in the row. 
        </li>
        <li>
             Because the PDB is a fully contained self describing record it also provides multiple 
             tables to annotate the record.  Each table appears to be delimited by a line in the 
             file "...".

        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Tim Finin)</span>
        </p>
	<p>The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has run various conferences on
	extracting information from text centered around challenge problems. Participants submit the output
	of their systems on an evaluation dataset to NIST for scoring, typically in the form of tab-separated format.
	</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.nist.gov/tac/2013/KBP/ColdStart/guidelines/KBP2013_ColdStartTaskDescription_1.1.pdf">2013 NIST Cold Start Knowledge Base Population Task</a>, for example, asks participants to extract
	facts from text and to represent these as triples along with associated metadata that include provenance
	and certainty values. A line in the submission format consists of a triple (subject-predicate-object) and, for some
	predicates, provenance information. Provenance includes a document ID and, depending on the predicate, one
	or three pairs of string offsets within the document. For predicates that are relations, an optional second
	set of provenance values can be provided. Each line can also have an optional float as a final column to represent
	a certainty measure.
	</p>

	<p>The following lines show examples of possible triples of varying length. In the second line, D00124 is the ID of a document
	and the strings like 283-286 refer to strings in a document using the offsets of the first and last characters.
	The final floating point value on some lines is the optional certainty value.</p>
	
	<div class="example"><div class="example-title"><span>Example 20</span></div><pre class="example">{snip}
:e4 type         PER
:e4 mention      "Bart"  D00124 283-286
:e4 mention      "JoJo"  D00124 145-149 0.9

{snip}</pre></div>
	<p>The submission format does not require that each line have the same number of columns. The expected provenance
	information for a triple depends on the predicate. For example, “type” typically has no provenance, “mention” has
	a document ID and offset pair, and domain predicates like “per:age” have one or two provenance records each of which
	has a document ID and three offset pairs.
	</p>
	<p>The file format exemplified above opens up for a number of issues described as follows.</p>
	Each row is intended to describe an entity (e.g. the subject of the triple, “:e4”). The unique identifier for that 
	entity is provided in the first column. In order for information about this entity to be reconcilled with 
	information from other sources about the same entity, the local identifier needs to be mapped to a globally 
	unique identifier such as a URI.<p></p>
	<p>
	<strong>Requires:</strong>
	<a href="#R-URIMapping">URIMapping</a>.
	</p>
	<p>After each triple, there is a variable number of annotations representing the provenance of the triple and, occasionally,
	its certainty. This information has to be properly identified and managed.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Requires:</strong>
	<a href="#R-AnnotationAndSupplementaryInfo">AnnotationAndSupplementaryInfo</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Entities “:e4”, “:e7” and “:e9” appear to be (foreign key) references to other entities described in this or in external tables. Likewise, also the
	identifiers “D00124” and “D00101” are ambiguous identifiers. It would be useful to identify the resources that these references represent.</p>
	<p>Moreover, “per” appears to be a term from a controlled vocabulary. How do we know which controlled vocabulary it is a member of and what its authoritative
	definition is?</p>	
	<strong>Requires:</strong>
	<a href="#R-ForeignKeyReferences">ForeignKeyReferences</a>,
	<a href="#R-AssociationOfCodeValuesWithExternalDefinitions">AssociationOfCodeValuesWithExternalDefinitions</a> and
	<a href="#R-SemanticTypeDefinition">SemanticTypeDefinition</a>.
	<p></p>
	<p>The identifiers used for the entities (“:e4”, “:e7” and “:e9”), as well as those used for the predicates (e.g. “type”, “mention”,
	“per:siblings” etc.), are ambiguous local identifiers. How can one make the identifier an unambiguous URI?
	A similar requirement regards the provenance annotations. These are composed by document (e.g. “D00124”) and page number ranges.
	(e.g. “180-181”). Page number ranges are clearly valid only in the context of the preceding document identifier. The interesting assertion about provenance
	is the reference (document plus page range). Thus we might
	want to give the reference a unique identifier comprising from document ID and page range (e.g. D00124#180-181).</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Requires:</strong>
	<a href="#R-URIMapping">URIMapping</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Besides the entities, the table presents also some values. Some of these are strings (e.g. “10”, “Bart”), some of them are probably floating point values (e.g. “0.9”).
	It would be useful to have an explicit syntactic type definition for these values.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Requires:</strong>
	<a href="#R-SyntacticTypeDefinition">SyntacticTypeDefinition</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Entity “:e4” is the subject of many rows, meaning that many rows can be combined to make a composite set of statements about this entity.</p>
	<p>Moreover, a single row in the table comprises a triple (subject-predicate-object), one or more provenance references and an optional certainty measure.
	The provenance references have been normalised for compactness (e.g. so they fit on a single row). However, each provenance statement has the same target triple so one
	could unbundle the composite row into multiple simple statements that have a regular number of columns (see the two equivalent examples below).

	<p>Lastly, since we already observed that rows comprise triples, that there is a frequent reference to externally
	defined vocabularies, that values are defined as text (literals), and that triples are also composed by entities,
	for which we aim to obtain a URI (as described above), it may be useful to be able to convert such a table in RDF.

        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Jeni Tennison)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the data repositories based on the <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a> software, such 
          as <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.data.gov">data.gov</a>, and many 
          others, use JSON as the representation of the data when providing a preview of CSV data within a browser. 
          Server side pre-processing of the CSV files is performed to try and determine column 
          types, clean the data and transform the CSV-encoded data to JSON in order to provide the preview. JSON has many 
          features which make it ideal for delivering a preview of the data, originally in CSV format, 
          to the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Javascript is a hard dependency for interacting with data in the browser and as such
          JSON was used as the serialization format because it was the most appropriate format for 
          delivering those data.  As the object notation for Javascript JSON is natively understood 
          by Javascript it is therefore possible to use the data without any external dependencies.  
          The values in the data delivered map directly to common Javascript types and libraries for 
          processing and generating JSON, with appropriate type conversion, are widely available for 
          many programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond basic knowledge of how to work with JSON, there is no further burden on the user 
          to understand complex semantics around how the data should be interpreted. The user of the 
          data can be assured that the data is correctly encoded as UTF-8 and it is easily queryable 
          using common patterns used in everyday Javascript. None of the encoding and 
          serialization flaws with CSV are apparent, although badly structured CSV files will be 
          mirrored in the JSON.

        </p>
        <p>When providing the in-browser previews of CSV-formatted data, the utility of the preview application 
          is limited because the server-side processing of the CSV is not always able to determine 
          the data types (e.g. date-time) associated with data columns. As a result it is not possible 
          for the in-browser preview to offer functions such as sorting rows by date.</p>

         <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Eric Stephan)</span>
        </p>
         <p> NetCDF is a set of binary data formats, programming interfaces, and software libraries that help read and write scientific data files.
             NetCDF provides scientists a means to share measured or simulated experiments with one another across the web.  What makes
             NetCDF useful is its ability to be self describing and provide a means for scientists to rely on existing data model
             as opposed to needing to write their own. The classic NetCDF data model consists of variables, dimensions, and attributes. 
             This way of thinking about data was introduced with the very first NetCDF release, and is still the core of all NetCDF files.
          </p>
          <p>Among the tools available to the NetCDF community, two tools:  ncdump and ncgen.  The ncdump tool is used
             by scientists wanting to inspect variables and attributes (metadata) contained in the NetCDF file.  It also 
             can provide a full text extraction of data including blocks of tabular data representing by variables.
             While NetCDF files are typically written by a software client, it is possible to generate NetCDF files using
             ncgen and ncgen3 from a text format.  The ncgen tool parses the text file and stores it in a binary format. 
          </p>
      <p>    Both ncdump and ncgen rely on a text format to represent the NetCDF file called network Common Data form
             Language (CDL).  The CDL syntax as shown below contains annotation along with blocks of data denoted by the
             "data:" key.  For the results to be legible for visual inspection the measurement data is written as delimited
             blocks of scalar values.  As shown in the example below CDL supports multiple variables or blocks of data.
             The blocks of data while delimited need to be thought of as a vector or single column of tabular data
             wrapped around to the next line in a similar way that characters can be wrapped around in a single cell block
             of a spreadsheet to make the spreadsheet more visually appealing to the user.
      </p>
       <div class="example"><div class="example-title"><span>Example 25</span></div><pre class="example">netcdf foo {    // example NetCDF specification in CDL

dimensions:
lat = 10, lon = 5, time = unlimited;

variables:
  int     lat(lat), lon(lon), time(time);
  float   z(time,lat,lon), t(time,lat,lon);
  double  p(time,lat,lon);
  int     rh(time,lat,lon);

  lat:units = "degrees_north";
  lon:units = "degrees_east";
  time:units = "seconds";
  z:units = "meters";
  z:valid_range = 0., 5000.;
  p:_FillValue = -9999.;
  rh:_FillValue = -1;

data:
  lat   = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90;
  lon   = -140, -118, -96, -84, -52;
}</pre></div>

           The next example shows a small subset of data block taken from an actual NetCDF file. 
           The blocks of data while delimited need to be thought of as a vector or single column

          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by David Booth and Jeremy Tandy)</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>CSV is by far the commonest format within which open data is published, and is thus
          typical of the data that application developers need to work with.</p>
        
        <p>However, an object / object graph serialisation (of open data) is easier to consume within
          software applications. For example, web applications (using HTML5 &amp; Javascript) require
          no extra libraries to work with data in JSON format. Similarly, RDF-encoded data in from 
          multiple sources can be simply combined or merged using SPARQL queries once persisted
          within a triple store.</p>
        
        <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential">
          UK Government policy paper "Open Data: unleashing the potential"</a> outlines a 
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78946/CM8353_acc.pdf#page=23">
            set of principles for publishing open data</a>. Within this document, <dfn id="dfn-principle-9">principle 9</dfn> states:</p>
        
        <p>
          <em>Release data quickly, and then work to make sure that it is available in open standard 
            formats, including linked data formats.</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>The open data principles recognise how the additional utility to be gained from publishing in 
          <em>linked data formats</em> must be balanced against the additional effort incurred by the
          data publisher to do so and the resulting delay to publication of the data. Data publishers
          are required to <em>release data quickly</em> - which means making the data available in
          a format convenient for them such as CSV dumps from databases or spread sheets.</p>
        
        <p>One of the hindrances to publishing in <em>linked data formats</em> is the difficulty in
          determining the ontology or vocabulary (e.g. the classes, predicates, namespaces and 
          other usage patterns) that should be used to describe the data. Whilst it is
          only reasonable to assume that a data publisher best knows the intended meaning of their
          data, they cannot be expected to determine the ontology or vocabulary most applicable to 
          to a consuming application!</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, in lieu of agreed de facto standard vocabularies or ontologies for a given 
          application domain, it is highly likely that disparate applications will conform to different data 
          models. How should the data publisher choose which of the available vocabularies or 
          ontologies to use when publishing (if indeed they are aware of those applications at all)!</p>
        
        <p>In order to assist data publishers provide data in <em>linked data formats</em> without 
          the need to determine ontologies or vocabularies, it is necessary to separate the <em>syntactic
            mapping</em> (e.g. changing format from CSV to JSON) from the <em>semantic mapping</em>
          (e.g. defining the transformations required to achieve semantic alignment with a target
          data model).</p>
        
        <p>As a result of such separation, it will be possible to establish a <em>canonical</em> 
          transformation from CSV conforming to the 
          core tabular data model [<cite><a href="#bib-tabular-data-model" class="bibref">tabular-data-model</a></cite>]
          to an object graph serialisation such as JSON.</p>

          <a href="#R-CanonicalMappingInLieuOfAnnotation">CanonicalMappingInLieuOfAnnotation</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>This use case assumes that JSON is the target serialisation for application developers
          given the general utility of that format. However, by considering JSON-LD [<cite><a href="#bib-json-ld" class="bibref">json-ld</a></cite>], it becomes 
          trivial to map CSV-encoded tabular data via JSON into a canonical RDF model. In doing so
          this enables CSV-encoded tabular data to be published in <em>linked data formats</em> 
          as required in the open data <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-principle-9">principle 9</a> at no extra effort to the data publisher as
          standard mechanisms are available for a data user to transform the data from CSV to RDF.</p>

        <p>In addition, open data principle 14 requires that:</p>

          <em>Public bodies should publish relevant metadata about their datasets […]; and they
            should publish supporting descriptions of the format, provenance and meaning of the data. </em>
        </p>
        
        <p>To achieve this, data publishers need to be able to publish supplementary metadata concerning
          their tabular datasets, such as title, usage license and description.</p>

        <p>Applications may automatically determine the data type (e.g. date-time, number) associated 
          with cells in a CSV file by parsing the data values. However, on occasion, this is prone to 
          mistakes where data <em>appears</em> to resemble something else. This is especially
          prevalent for dates. For example, <code>1/4</code> is often confused with <code>1 April</code>
          rather than <code>0.25</code>. In such situations, it is beneficial if guidance can be given to the
          transformation process indicating the data type for given columns.</p>

        <p>Provision of CSV data coupled with a canonical mapping provides significant utility by itself. However, 
          there is nothing stopping a data publisher from adding annotation defining data semantics once, say,
          an appropriate de facto standard vocabulary has been agreed within the community of use. Similarly, a 
          data consumer may wish to work directly with the canonical mapping and wish to ignore any semantic
          annotations provided by the publisher.</p>

          <p>This use case lacks a concrete example to further illustrate the concerns. Whilst the concerns

	</p>
	<p>The challenge mandates the use of Linked Open Data resources in the recommendations.</p>
	<p>An effective manner to satisfy this requirement is to make use of undirected semantic paths. 
	An undirected semantic path is a sequence of entities (subject or object) and properties that link two items, for instance: </p>

	<pre>	{Book1 property1 Object1 property2 Book2}
	</pre>

	<p>This sequence results from considering the triples (subject-predicate-object) in a given Linked Open Data resource (e.g. DBpedia),
	independently of their direction, such that the starting and the ending entities are the desired items and that the subject (or object) of
	a triple is the object (or subject) of the following triple.
	For example, the sequence above may result from the following triples:</p>

	<pre>	Book1 property1 Object1
	Book2 property1 Object1
	</pre>

	<p>
	Undirected semantic paths are classified according to their length. Fixed a length, one can extract all the undirected semantic paths of that length
	that link two items within a Linked Open Data resource by running a set of SPARQL queries.
	This is necessary because an undirected semantic path actually corresponds to the union of a set of directed semantic paths. In the source, data are stored
	in terms of directed triples (subject-predicate-object).
	</p>
	<p>
	  The number of queries that is necessary to run in order to obtain all the undirected semantic paths that link to items is exponential of the
	  length of the path itself (2<sup>n</sup>). Because of the complexity of this task and of the possible latency times deriving from
	  it, it might be useful to cache these results.
	</p>

	<p>CSV is a good candidate for caching undirected semantic paths, because of its ease of use, sharing, reuse. However, there are some open issues
	related to this.
	First, since paths may present a variable number of components, one might want to represent paths in a single cell,
	while being able to separate the path elements when necessary.
	</p>
	<p>For example, in <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl/~vmo600/book_paths.tar.gz">this file</a>, undirected semantic paths are grouped by means
	of double quotes, and path components are separated by commas. The starting and ending elements of the undirected semantic paths (Book1 and Book2) are represented
	in two separate columns by means of the book identifiers used in the challenge (see the example below).
	</p>

	<div class="example"><div class="example-title"><span>Example 30</span></div><pre class="example">Book1	Book2	Path
{snip}
1	7680	"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/language,http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/language"
1	2	"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/author,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diana_Gabaldon,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/author"

	        <a href="#R-RepeatedProperties">RepeatedProperties</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Second, the size of these caching files may be remarkable. For example, the size of this file described above is ~2GB, and that may imply prohibitive
	loading times, especially when making a limited number of recommendations.</p>
	<p>Since rows are sorted according to the starting and the ending book of the undirected semantic path, then all the undirected semantic paths that link two books
	are present in a region of the table formed by consecutive rows.</p>
	<p>By having at our disposal an annotation of such regions indicating which book they describe, one might be able to select the "slice" of
	the file he needs to make a recommendation, without having to load it entirely.</p>

	      <p>Writing systems affect the way in which information is displayed. In some cases, these writing 
          systems affect the order in which characters are displayed. Latin based languages display text 
          left-to-right across a page (LTR). Languages such as Arabic and Hebrew are written in scripts 
          whose dominant direction is right to left (RTL) when displayed, however when it involves 
          non-native text or numbers it is actually bidirectional.</p>
        <p>Irrespective of the LTR or RTL display of characters in a given language, data is serialised 
          such that the bytes are ordered in one sequential order.</p>

          Readers should be aware that both the right-to-left text direction and the cursive nature of Arabic text

        </p>
        
        <p>A citizen scientist investigating biodiversity in the Parque Nacional de Sierra Nevada,
        Spain, aims to create a compelling web application that combines biodiversity
        information with other environmental factors - displaying this information on a map and
        as summary statistics.</p>
        
        <p>The <a href="http://www.gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)</a>,
        a government funded open data initiative that spans over 600 institutions worldwide, has
        mobilised more that <a href="http://www.gbif.org/occurrence">435 million records
        describing the occurrence of flora and fauna</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Included in their data holdings is <a href="http://www.gbif.org/dataset/db6cd9d7-7be5-4cd0-8b3c-fb6dd7446472">
        "Sinfonevada: Dataset of Floristic diversity in Sierra Nevada forest (SE Spain)"</a>,
        containing around 8000 records belonging to 270 taxa collected between January 2004 and
        December 2005.</p>
        
        <p>As with the majority of datasets published via GBIF, the Sinfonevada dataset is available
        in the <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/index.htm">Darwin Core Archive
        format</a> (DwC-A).</p>
        
        <p>In accordance with the DwC-A specification, the Sinfonevada dataset is packaged as a zip
        file containing:
          </p><ul>
            <li>tab delimited tabular data file: <code>occurrence.txt</code></li>
            <li>metadata describing that tabular data file: <code>meta.xml</code></li>
            <li>supplementary dataset metadata: <code>eml.xml</code></li>
          </ul>
        <p></p>
        
        <p>The metadata file included in the zip package must always be named <code>meta.xml</code>,
        whilst the tabular data file and supplementary metadata are explicitly identified within the 
        main metadata file.</p>
        
        <p>A copy of the <a href="dwca-sinfonevada.zip">zip package</a> is provided for reference. Snippets of
        the tab delimited tabular data file and the full metdata file "meta.xml" are provided below.</p>

        <p>The key variances of this tabular data file with RFC 4180 is the use of TAB
        <code>%x09</code> as the cell delimiter and LF <code>%x0A</code> as the row
        terminator.</p>
        
        <p>Also note the use of two adjacent TAB characters to indicate an empty cell.</p>

        <p>The <code>ignoreHeaderLines</code> attribute can be used to ignore files with column
        headings or preamble comments.</p> 
        
        <p>In this particular case, the tabular data file is packaged within the zip file, and
        is referenced locally. However, the DwC-A specification also supports annotation of remote
        tabular data files, and thus does not require any modification of the source datafiles
        themselves.</p>

          <a href="#R-IndependentMetadataPublication">IndependentMetadataPublication</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Although not present in this example, DwC-A also supports the ability to specify
        a property-value pair that is applied to every row in the tabular data file, or, 
        in the case of sparse data, for that property-value pair to be added where the property
        is absent from the data file (e.g. providing a default value for a property).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Requires:</strong>
          <a href="#R-SpecificationOfPropertyValuePairForEachRow">SpecificationOfPropertyValuePairForEachRow</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Future releases of DwC-A also seek to provide stronger typing of data formats;
        at present only date formats are validated.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Requires:</strong>
          <a href="#R-SyntacticTypeDefinition">SyntacticTypeDefinition</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Whilst the DwC-A format is embedded in many software platforms, including web based tools,
        none of these seem to fit the needs of the citizen scientist. They want to use existing
        javascript libraries such as <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, an open-Source 
        javascript library for interactive maps, where possible to simplify their web development 
        effort.</p>
        
        <p>Leaflet has good support for <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a>, a JSON format
        for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.</p>
        
        <p>In the absence of standard tooling, the citizen scientist needs to write a custom parser
        to convert the tab delimited data into GeoJSON. An example GeoJSON object resulting from
        this transformation is provided below.</p>

        <p>The citizen scientist notes that many of the terms in a given row are drawn from controlled
        vocabularies; geographic names and taxonomies. For the application, they want to be able to
        refer to the authoritative definitions for these controlled vocabularies, say, to provide

        <p>Thinking to the future of their application, our citizen scientist anticipates the need
        to aggregate data across multiple datasets; each of which might use different column headings
        depending on who compiled the tabular dataset. Furthermore, how can one be sure they are
        comparing things of equivalent type?</p>
        
        <p>To remedy this, they want to use the definitions from the metadata file
        <code>meta.xml</code>. The easiest approach to achieve this is to modify their parser
        to export [<cite><a href="#bib-json-ld" class="bibref">json-ld</a></cite>] and transform the tabular data into RDF that can be easily
        reconciled.</p>

          of general metadata vocabulary for describing CSV files, or indeed any tabular text
          datasets, will mean that DwC-A can be deprecated. This would allow the biodiversity
          community, and initiatives such as GBIF, to spend their efforts developing tools that
          support the generic standard rather than their own domain specific conventions and
          specifications, thus increasing the accessibility of biodiversity data.</p>
          
          <p>To achieve this goal, it essential that the key characteristics of the DwC-A format 
          can be adequately described, thus enabling the general metadata vocabulary to be adopted
          without needing to modify the existing DwC-A encoded data holdings.</p>

        <p><a href="https://spendnetwork.com//">spendnetwork.com</a> harvests spending data from multiple UK local and central government CSV files. 
          It adds new metadata and annotations to the data and cross-links suppliers to <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> and, 
          elsewhere, is beginning to map transaction types to different categories of spending.</p>

        <p>A snippet of data from East Sussex County Council indicating payments over £500 for the second financial quarter of 2011 is below to illustrate. 
          White space has been added for clarity. The full data file for that period (saved in CSV format from Microsoft Excel 2007) is provided here:

        <p>The schema here is defined by a third party (spendnetwork.com) to <strong>make sense</strong> of the original data within their own model 
          (only some of which is shown here, spendnetwork.com also tries to categorize transactions and more). This model exists independently of 
          multiple source datasets and entails a mechanism for reusers to link <strong>to</strong> the original data <strong>from</strong> the metadata. 
          Published metadata can be seen variously as feedback, advertising, enrichment or annotations. Such information could help the publisher to 
          improve the quality of the original source, however, for the community at large it reduces the need for repetition of the work done to make 
          sense of the data and facilitates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>. It may also be the case that 
          the metadata creator is better able to put the original data into a wider context with more accuracy and commitment than the original publisher.</p>
        <p>Another (similar) scenario is <a href="http://lginform.local.gov.uk/">LG-Inform</a>. This harvests government statistics from multiple sources, 
          many in CSV format, and calculate rates, percentages &amp; trends etc. and packages them as a set of performance metrics/measures. Again, it 
          would be very useful for the original publisher to know, through metadata, that their source has been defined and used (potentially alongside 
          someone else's data) in this way.</p>
        <p>See <a href="http://standards.esd.org.uk/">http://standards.esd.org.uk/</a> and the "Metrics" tab therein; e.g. 
          <a href="http://standards.esd.org.uk/?uri=metricType%2F3333">percentage of measured children in reception year classified as obese (3333)</a>.</p>
        <p>The analysis of datasets undertaken by both spendnetwork.com and LG-Inform to make sense of other people's tabular data is time-consuming 
          work. Making that metadata available is a potential help to the original data publisher as well as other would-be reusers of it.</p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Tim Davies)</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>During a crisis response, information managers within the humanitarian community face 
        a significant challenge in trying to collate data regarding humanitarian needs and response 
        activities conducted by a large number of humanitarian actors. The schemas for these data 
        sets are generally not standardized across different actors nor are the mechanisms for 
        sharing the data. In the best case, this results in a significant delay between the collection 
        of data and the formulation of that data into a common operational picture. In the worst case, 
        information is simply not shared at all, leaving gaps in the understanding of the field situation.
        </p>
        
        <p>The <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hxlproject/home">Humanitarian eXchange Language</a> 
        (HXL) project seeks to address this concern; enabling information from diverse parties to be
        collated into a single "Humanitarian Data Registry". Supporting tools are provided to assist
        participants in a given response initiative in finding information within this registry to 
        meet their needs.</p>
        
        <p>The HXL standard is designed to be a common publishing format for humanitarian data. 
        A key design principle of the HXL project is that the data publishers are able to continue
        publication of their data using their existing systems. Unsurprisingly, data publishers 
        often provide their data in tabular formats such as CSV, having exported the content from 
        spreadsheet applications. As a result, the HXL standard is entirely based on tabular data.</p>
                
        <p>During their engagement with the humanitarian response community, the HXL project team 
        have identified two major concerns when working with tabular data:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Tabular data needs to be created, read by and exchanged between people speaking 
            different languages. Many of these are basic spreadsheet users who find it 
            far easier to use data with natural and clear language in the column headings. 
            Having the column headings in their own language makes creating and interpreting 
            the data a lot easier.</li>
          <li>Tabular data needs to be created that contains literal values in multiple languages. 
            For example, the name of a town in English, French and Arabic. The total number of 
            languages that the data might be expressed in cannot be easily determined in advance, 
            and it should be possible for a data manager to introduce a new language variant of 
            a column easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        
        <p>To address these issues, the HXL project have developed a number of 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1srkEdEQiMEYDmk0Jo2rWpsFStYcgp5XaqYJQON6lfvU/edit?pli=1">conventions</a>  
        for publishing tabular data in CSV format.</p>
        
        <p>Instead of relying on matching text strings, a 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aq2ojDnceIcTNdLWVKP856AuFPItJP1TWwMaPrKPXXw/edit?pli=1#gid=0">data dictionary</a>
        provides a set of short (3-character) identifier for each field type. These field 
        codes are provided on the first row of the CSV file. The second row of the CSV file
        provides a textual column name - as determined in the natural language of the data
        publisher. The field code is normative, whilst the textual column name is merely
        informative.</p>

        <p>Finally, note that the humanitarian data often includes codes to reference some authoritative 
        term, definition or other resource; e.g. the <em>Province code</em> <code>60400000</code>. In order
        to establish links between data sets, these codes must be reconciled with their official definitions.</p>

        HXL build on a tabular data model, rather than a graph data model, the HXL project are reviewing the

        <p>The CSV file follows the specification outlined in [<cite><a href="#bib-RFC4180" class="bibref">RFC4180</a></cite>] - including the use of 
        pairs of double quotes (<code>""</code>) to escape cells that themselves contain commas.</p>

        <p>Also note that each row provides a unique identifier for the occupation it describes. This
        unique identifier is given in the <code>O*NET-SOC 2010 Code</code> column. This code can be considered
        as the primary key for each row in the listing as it is unique for every row. Furthermore, the value 
        of the <code>O*NET-SOC 2010 Code</code> column serves as the unique identifier for the occupation.</p>

        <p>Closer inspection of the O*NET-SOC 2010 code illustrates the hierarchical classification
        within the taxonomy. The first six digits are based on the 
        <a href="http://www.bls.gov/soc/">Standard Occupational Classification</a> (SOC) 
        code from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with further subcategorization thereafter where necessary. 
        The first and second digits represent the major group; the third digit represents the minor group; 
        the fourth and fifth digits represent the broad occupation; and the sixth digit represents the 
        detailed occupation.</p>

        <p>Being familiar with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">SKOS</a>, our user decides 
        to map both the O*NET-SOC and SOC taxonomies into a single hierarchy expressed using RDF/OWL and the 
        SKOS vocabulary.</p>
        
        <p>Note that in order to express the two taxonomies in SKOS, the local identifiers used in
        the CSV files (e.g. <code>15-1199.03</code>) must be mapped to URIs.</p>

        <p>Each of the five levels used across the occupation classification schemes are assigned
        to a particular OWL class - each of which is a sub-class of 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#Concept">skos:Concept</a>:

        <p>The SOC taxonomy contains four different types of entities, and so requires several different
        passes to extract each of those from the CSV file. Depending on which kind of entity is being 
        extracted, a different column provides the unique identifier for the entity. Data in a given
        row is only processed if the value for the cell designated as the unique identifier is not blank.
        For example, if the <code>Detailed Occupation</code> column is designated as providing the 
        unique identifier (e.g. to extract entities of type <code>ex:SOC-DetailedOccupation</code>), 
        then the only rows to be processed in the snippet below would be "Financial Specialists, All Other",
        "Computer and Information Research Scientists" and "Computer Occupations, All Other". All other rows
        would be ignored.</p>

        <p>The hierarchy in the SOC structure is implied by <em>inheritance</em> from
        the preceeding row(s). For example, the row describing SOC minor group "Computer Occupations" 
        (<code>Minor Group</code> = <code>15-1100</code> (above) has an empty cell value for column <code>Major Group</code>.
        The value for SOC major group is provided by the preceeding row. In the case of SOC detailed 
        occupation "Computer Occupations, All Other" (<code>Detailed Occupation</code> = <code>15-1199</code>), 
        the value of value for column <code>Major Group</code> is provided 20 lines previously when a value
        in that column was most recently provided. The example snippet below illustrates what the CSV would
        look like if the <em>inherited</em> cell values were present:</p>

        <p>(whitespace added for clarity)</p>

        <p>It is difficult to programatically describe how the inherited values should be implemented.
        It is not as simple as infering the value for a blank cell from the most recent preceeding row 
        when a non-blank value was provided for that column. For example, the last row in the example 
        above describing "Mathematical Science Occupations" does not inherit the values from columns 
        <code>Broad Group</code> and <code>Detailed Occupation</code> in the preceeding row because 
        it describes a new level in the hierarchy.</p>

        <p>However, given that the SOC code is a string value with regular structure that reflects
        the position of a given concept within the hierarchy, it is possible to determine the
        identifier of each of the broader concepts by parsing the identifier string. For example, 
        the regular expression <code>/^(\d{2})-(\d{2})(\d)\d$/</code> could be used to split the
        identifier for a detailed occupation code into its constituent parts from which the 
        identifiers for the associated broader concepts could be constructed.</p>

        <div class="issue"><div id="h_issue_4" role="heading" aria-level="3" class="issue-title"><span>Issue 4</span></div><div class="">
          <p>The REGEXP needs to be verified as correct.</p>
        </div></div>

        <p><strong>Requires:</strong>
          <a href="#R-CellMicrosyntax">CellMicrosyntax</a>.</p>

        <p>The same kind of processing applies to the O*NET-SOC taxonomy; in this case also extracting
        a description for the occupation. There is also an additional complication: where a 
        O*NET-SOC code ends in "<code>.00</code>", that occupation is a direct mapping to the 
        occupation defined in the SOC taxonomy. For example, the O*NET-SOC code <code>15-1199.00</code> 
        refers to the same occupation category as the SOC code <code>15-1199</code>: 
        "Computer Occupations, All Other"</p>

        <p>To implement this complication, we need to use conditional processing.</p> 
        <p>If the final two digits of the O*NET-SOC code are "<code>00</code>", then: 
          </p><ul>
            <li>the entity is of type <code>ex:SOC-DetailedOccupation</code>;</li>
            <li>the unique identifier and notation for the concept comprises only the six numerical 
              digits of the <code>O*NET-SOC 2010 Code</code> cell value (e.g. in the form 
              <code>nn-nnnn</code>); and</li>
            <li>no <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#broader">skos:broader</a>
              relationship need be defined.</li> 
          </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>else: 
          </p><ul>
            <li>the entity is of type <code>ex:ONETSOC-Occupation</code>;</li>
            <li>the unique identifier and notation for the concept comprises the eight numerical 
              digits of the <code>O*NET-SOC 2010 Code</code> cell value (e.g. in the form 
              <code>nn-nnnn.nn</code>); and</li>
            <li>a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#broader">skos:broader</a>
              relationship is defined with the broader concept from the SOC taxonomy identified 
              by the first six numerical digits of the <code>O*NET-SOC 2010 Code</code>cell value.</li> 
          </ul>
        <p></p>

                <strong>Ability to parse internal data structure within a cell value</strong>
              </em>
              <p>Cell values may represent more complex data structures for a given column such as lists and time stamps.
              The presence of complex data structures within a given cell is referred to as microsyntax.</p>
              <p>If present parsers should have the option of handling the microsyntax or ignoring it and treating it as
              a scalar value.
              </p>
              <p>Looking in further detail at the uses of microsyntax, four types of usage are prevalent:
                </p><ol>
                  <li>various date/time syntaxes (not just ISO-8601 ones)</li>
                  <li>delimited lists of literal values to express multiple values of the same property
                    (typically comma "<code>,</code>" delimited, but other delimiters are also used)</li>
                  <li>embedded structured data such as XML, JSON or 
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">well-known-text (WKT) literals</a></li>
                  <li>semi structured text</li>
                </ol>
              <p></p>
              <p>The following requirements pertain to describing and parsing microsyntax:
                </p><ul>
                  <li>to document microsyntax so that humans can understand 
                    what it is conveying; e.g. to provide human-readable annotation</li>
                  <li>to validate the cell values to ensure they conform to the expected microsyntax</li>
                  <li>to label the value as being in a particular microsyntax when converting into 
                    JSON/XML/RDF; e.g. marking an XML value as an <code>XMLLiteral</code> or a datetime
                    value as <code>xsd:dateTime</code></li>
                  <li>to process the microsyntax into an appropriate data structure when converting 
                    into JSON/XML/RDF</li>
                </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>The ability to declare that a column within a tabular data file carries values of a 
              particular type, and the potential validation of the cell against the declared type,
              is covered in <a href="#R-SyntacticTypeDefinition">R-SyntacticTypeDefinition</a>
              and is not discussed further here.</p>
                           
              <p>We can consider cell values with microsyntax to be annotated strings. The annotation (which might 
              include a definition of the format of the string - such as defining the delimiter used for a list) 
              can be used to validate the string and (in some cases) convert it into a suitable value or data 
              structure.</p> 
              <p>Microsyntax, therefore, requires manipulation of the text if processed. Typically, this will
              relate to conversion of lists into multiple-valued entries, but may also include reformatting of
              text to convert between formats (e.g. to convert a datetime value to a date, or locale dates to
              ISO 8601 compliant syntax).</p>
              
              <div class="note"><div id="h_note_16" role="heading" aria-level="4" class="note-title"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">
                <p>We assume that lists of values within a given cell all refer to items of the same type - 
                  such as a list of authors for a journal article.</p>
              </div></div>     
              
              <div class="note"><div id="h_note_17" role="heading" aria-level="4" class="note-title"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">
                <p>At this time, there is no expectation for CSV parsers to be able to take cells with embedded 
                  structure (e.g. XML, JSON, WKT etc.) or arbitrarily semi-structured text and convert them into 
                  JSON/XML/RDF.</p>
                <p>Validation of the embedded structure is assumed to be limited to validation of
                  <em>syntax</em> rather than structure (e.g. ensuring that what is declared as XML is valid XML).
                  No attempt should be made to, say, validate XML content against a XML Schema Document. Please refer
                  to <a href="#R-SyntacticTypeDefinition">R-SyntacticTypeDefinition</a> for more details on validation
                  of data types.</p>

                <p>To express semantics in a machine readable form, RDF seems the appropriate choice.
                  Furthermore, best practice indicates that one should adopt common and widely adopted
                  patterns (e.g. RDF vocabularies, OWL ontologies) when publishing data to enable a
                  wide audience to consume and understand the data. Existing (de facto) standard
                  patterns may add complexity when defining the semantics associated with a particular
                  row such that a single RDF predicate is insufficient. </p>
                <p>For example, to express a quantity value using <a href="http://qudt.org/">QUDT</a>
                  we use an instance of <code>qudt:QuantityValue</code> to relate the numerical value
                  with the quantity kind (e.g. air temperature) and unit of measurement (e.g.
                  Celsius). Thus the semantics needed for a column containing temperature values might
                  be: <code>qudt:value/qudt:numericValue</code> – more akin to a <a href="http://marmotta.apache.org/ldpath/language.html">LDPath</a>.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, use of OWL axioms when defining a sub-property of
                  <code>qudt:value</code> would allow the quantity type and unit of measurement to
                  be inferred, with the column semantics then being specified as
                  <code>ex:temperature_Cel/qudt:numericValue</code>.</p>

                <strong>Ability to provide multiple values of a given property for a single entity described within a tabular data file</strong>
              </em>
              <p>It is commonplace for a tabular data file to provide multiple values of a given property
              for a single entity. This may be achieved in a number of ways.</p>
              <p>First, the multiple rows may be used to describe the same entity; each such row using the same 
                unique identifier for the entity. For example, a country, identified using its 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">two-letter country code</a>, 
                may have more than one name:</p>
              <div class="example"><div class="example-title"><span>Example 53</span></div><pre class="example">CSV:
----

country,name
AD,     Andorra
AD,     Principality of Andorra
AF,     Afghanistan
AF,     Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

  "country": "AD",
  "name": [ "Andorra", "Principality of Andorra" ]
},{
  "country": "AF",
  "name": [ "Afghanistan", "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan" ]
}]</pre></div>

              <p>Second, a single row within a tabular data set may contain multiple values for a given property
                by declaring that multiple columns map to the same property. For example, multiple locations:</p>

                <p>In this case, it is essential to declare that each of the columns refer to the same property. In the 
                  example above, all the <code>geocode</code> columns in the example above map to 
                  <code><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/admingeo/gssCode">admin:gssCode</a></code>.</p>
