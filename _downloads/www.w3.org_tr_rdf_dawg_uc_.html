    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>This document specifies use cases, requirements, and objectives for an
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> query language and data access
    protocol. It suggests how an RDF query language and data access protocol
    could be used in the construction of novel, useful Semantic Web
    applications in areas like web publishing, personal information
    management, transportation, and tourism.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2><a name="status" id="status">Status of This Document</a></h2>
    <p>Since the October 2004 draft of this document, the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/">RDF Data Access Working Group</a> has</p>
    <ul>
      <li>adopted a WSDL requirement and
      a sorting objective (see <a href="#changes">change log</a>
      for details)</li>
      <li>postponed some design issues to a future version due to lack
      of implementation and design experience (<a
      href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/issues#cascadedQueries"
      >cascadedQueries</a>, <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/issues#accessingCollections"
      >accessingCollections</a>)</li>
      <li>changed our approach to the <a href="#d4.1">Human-friendly Syntax</a> objective (see issue <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/issues#punctuationSyntax"
      >punctuationSyntax</a> and upcoming design document revisions)

  <h1><a name="intro" id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h1>

  <p>The W3C's Semantic Web Activity is based on RDF's flexibility as a means
  of representing data. While there are several standards covering RDF
  itself, there has not yet been any work done to create standards for
  querying or accessing RDF data. There is no formal, publicly standardized
  language for querying RDF information. Likewise, there is no formal,
  publicly standardized data access protocol for interacting with remote or
  local RDF storage servers.</p>

  <p>Despite the lack of standards, developers in commercial and in open
  source projects have created <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/11/13-RDF-Query-Rules/">many query languages for
  RDF data</a>. But these languages lack both a common syntax and a common
  semantics. In fact, the extant query languages cover a significant semantic
  range: from declarative, SQL-like languages, to path languages, to rule or
  production-like systems. The existing languages also exhibit a range of
  extensibility features and built-in capabilities, including inferencing and
  distributed query.</p>

  <p>Further, there may be as many different methods of accessing remote RDF
  storage servers as there are distinct RDF storage server projects. Even
  where the basic access protocol is standardized in some sense&#8212;HTTP, SOAP,
  or XML-RPC&#8212;there is little common ground upon which to develop generic
  client support to access a wide variety of such servers.</p>

  <p>The following use cases characterize some of the most important and most
  common motivations behind the development of existing RDF query languages
  and access protocols. The use cases, in turn, inform decisions about
  <a href="#req">requirements</a>, that is, the critical features that a
  standard RDF query language and data access protocol require, as well as
  <a href="#dobj">design objectives</a> that aren't on the critical path.</p>

  <h2><a name="uc" id="uc">2. Use Cases</a></h2>

  <p>Each use case describes a user-oriented context in which the RDF query
  language or protocol or both are used to solve a real problem. However, it
  is not necessarily the case that the query language or data access protocol
  will directly address all of these use cases. (Some of the use cases
  contain illustrative RDF in Notation 3 form; consult <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer">Primer: Getting into the semantic
  web and RDF using N3</a> or <a href=
  "http://infomesh.net/2002/notation3/">Notation3: A Rough Guide to N3</a>
  for more details about N3.)</p>

  <p>George wants to send email to a person named "Johnny Lee Outlaw".
  George's personal address book, which includes contact information for a

  <p>Smiley works for a multinational media conglomerate. As part of his job
  as an editor of foreign market compilations, he needs to be notified
  whenever the conglomerate's knowledge bases contain information about new
  media objects&#8212;books, movies, and pop music&#8212;matching various properties:
  title, author, and price point.</p>

  <p>Smiley uses his web browser to create a query that will be executed
  regularly against the conglomerate's knowledge bases. Whenever there are
  new matches for Smiley's query, he receives an email with URIs to resources
  about the new matches; and Smiley's personal RSS feed is also updated with
  the new matches, since he uses an RSS aggregator to gather news every
  day.</p>

  <h3 class="dp"><a name="d4.10" id="d4.10">4.10 Addressable Query
  Results</a></h3>

  <p>A common pattern of access is to send a query, <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html">which is like asking a
  question</a>, to a remote service which evaluates it and returns the answer
  or results. This access pattern fits naturally into the architecture of the
  Web by making query results addressable resources.</p>

  <p>It must be possible for query results to be addressed in URI space.</p>
