<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="approach" id="approach"></a>1.1 Approach</h3><p>The Compound Document Formats Working Group is producing
	recommendations on combining separate component languages
	(e.g. XML-based languages, elements and attributes from
	separate vocabularies), like XHTML, SVG, XForms, MathML, and
	SMIL, with a focus on user interface markups.  When combining
	user interface markups, specific problems have to be resolved
	that are not addressed by the individual markups
	specifications, such as the propagation of events across
	markups, the combination of rendering or the user interaction
	model with a combined document. The Compound Document Formats
	working group will address these types of problems.  This work
	is divided in phases and two technical solutions: combining
	by reference and by inclusion.</p><p>The group is addressing the semantics of combining markups,
	which goes beyond the mechanics and syntactical elements used
	to combine markups.  The semantic of combining markup is, to a
	large extent, specific to any two markups being combined. For
	example, including SVG markup in an XHTML document can be done
	in various ways and there is a need to define how the
	combination is done and what it means, especially with regards
	to issues mentioned above (such as event propagation, user
	interactions or rendering). Because defining the combined
	semantics is complex, because the group needs to deliver a
	test suite and specific conformance requirements (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/CDF/admin/charter">charter</a>)
	and because there is a growing request to support specific
	versions of specific markups, the group will initially produce
	a specification that mandates specific versions of specific
	markup profiles. However, as explained in the following
	section, the group will structure its specification work such
	that generic combination concepts and techniques are part of a
	framework specification so that they can be easily referenced
	and reused in other contexts or in future specifications this
	group produces.</p><p>The use cases and requirements in this document will cover
	both combining by reference and inclusion, unless otherwise noted.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="phases-of-work" id="phases-of-work"></a>1.1.1 Phases of Work</h4><p>The phases of work lists a set of languages (with their
	  profiles) that are combined. As the languages differ by
	  their features and properties, different issues come up when
	  combining together different languages. Therefore, the phase
	  constrains the issues that are currently solved.</p><p>The standardization starts with a limited set of
	  languages. Once issues on these languages are solved, a next
	  larger package is started. The following phases contain more
	  languages and therefore, the corresponding recommendations
	  solve a wider variety of combination issues. </p><p>Each phase may result in:</p><ul><li><p>a new version of the Compound Document Framework
	    specification</p></li><li><p>(at least) one specific Profile specification
	    that uses the corresponding Compound Document
	    Framework. Each Profile specification will include a list
	    of specific supported languages (and profiles thereof) and
	    also include any supplemental integration notes as
	    necessary beyond what is described in the
	    Framework.</p></li></ul></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="intro-by-reference" id="intro-by-reference"></a>1.1.2 By Reference</h4><p>The first technical solution for combining document
	  formats is combination by reference. This means that
	  documents using different languages (XML vocabularies) are linked
	  by a reference such as XLink references, XHTML &lt;img&gt;, &lt;object&gt;
	  and XForms instance src attributes.
	  This allows separate languages to work together,
	  but it allows implementations of the languages be
	  separated. </p><p>The standardized issues are for example, how events flow
	  in multi-document environment, how different documents are
	  accessed by the scripts, and how different languages should
	  cooperate in drawing to the screen (or other media).</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="intro-by-inclusion" id="intro-by-inclusion"></a>1.1.3 By Inclusion</h4><p>
			A subsequent phase will address compound documents by inclusion, which is 
			combining more than one namespace vocabulary within the same document. For 
			example, a compound document with XHTML as the enclosing root schema which 
			contains nested XForms namespace elements, and SVG namespace elements, 
			and XML Events elements all in the same document. A compound document by 
			inclusion, may also contain reference to other separate documents, and 
			therefore may be a combination of inclusion and reference.
		</p><p>
			The standardization issues that will be addressed in the Compound 
			Documents by Inclusion Recommendation are how different namespace 
			vocabulary implementations will interact within the same document, and how 
			compound documents by inclusion should be loaded and processed by browser 
			user agents, as well as validated by authoring tools.

	languages. Most extensible languages provide this
	feature. The combining technologies and issues can be divided
	in two categories. The first category is how the combining
	is described. The second category is how the semantics of
	combining is understood. Each language specifies the first
	category. The combining recommendations try to solve the
	second.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-html-xhtml" id="relationships-html-xhtml"></a>1.3.1 HTML and XHTML</h4><p>HTML has an &lt;object&gt; element. This element can be used to
	  combine by reference.  The &lt;object&gt; element provides a way to
	  link to external documents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-xmlid" id="relationships-xmlid"></a>1.3.2 XML:id</h4><p>A mechanism allowing unique element identifiers to be recognized by all
	  conformant XML processors, whether they validate or not, is desirable in 
	  making XML sub-resource linking robust. The <em>xml:id</em> specification 
	  allows authors to identify elements with IDs that can be recognized by any 
	  processor without regard to how, or if, any internal or external 
	  declarations are available.
	  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-xlink" id="relationships-xlink"></a>1.3.3 XLink</h4><p>Xlink specifies a generic reusable vocabulary for links
	  in XML documents. An XLink may be specified on an arbitrary
	  element in such a way that an XLink enabled processor will
	  be able to understand the linking semantics of said element. A variety of
	  linking behaviors (embedding, hyperlinking, etc.) may be further
	  described using additional linking metadata.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-xinclude" id="relationships-xinclude"></a>1.3.4 XInclude</h4><p>XInclude specifies how to combine different infosets
	  together. This approach may be used for combination by
	  inclusion.</p><p>After the XInclude markup is processed, the WG's produced
	  recommendations will specify the semantics on how the application
	  should understand the compound document.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-xmlevents" id="relationships-xmlevents"></a>1.3.5 XML Events</h4><p>XML Events defines an extensible event specification method for XML.  
	  It provides for new event types without requiring modification to the 
	  DOM or document schema.  It also allows for integration into other host 
	  languages.
	  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-css" id="relationships-css"></a>1.3.6 CSS</h4><p>CSS is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach 
	  style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML 
	  documents and XML applications). CSS enables the separation the 
	  presentation style of documents from the content of documents.
	  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-dom" id="relationships-dom"></a>1.3.7 DOM</h4><p>The DOM Core specification is a platform- and language-neutral
	  interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and 
	  update the content, structure and style of documents.
	  </p><p>The DOM Events specification is a generic platform- and 
	  language-neutral event system which allows registration of event handlers,
	  describes event flow through a tree structure, and provides basic 
	  contextual information for each event.
	  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-svg" id="relationships-svg"></a>1.3.8 SVG</h4><p>SVG has a &lt;foreignObject&gt; element. This element can be used

	  provides a way to link to external documents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-mathml" id="relationships-mathml"></a>1.3.9 MathML</h4><p>MathML is an XML application for describing mathematical notation and 
	  capturing both its structure and content.
	  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-forms" id="relationships-forms"></a>1.3.10 XForms</h4><p>XForms is a schema designed to split documents into three
	  parts: the XForms model, the instance data, and the user
	  interface.  It provides a mechanism for expressing the data
	  and intent of a form and allowing browser/renderers the
	  flexibility to present the information most suitable for the
	  device currently rendering the form.  XForms supports
	  compound document by inclusion by design since it is not a
	  free-standing document type, and was always meant to be
	  enclosed by a root document.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-smil" id="relationships-smil"></a>1.3.11 SMIL</h4><p>SMIL technologies are closely related to combining by
	  reference. SMIL provides mechanisms (e.g., &lt;animation&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;
	  and &lt;video&gt; elements) to combine content and synchronize them in time.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-xbl" id="relationships-xbl"></a>1.3.12 XBL</h4><p>XBL is a mechanism for defining the presentation and interactive 
	  behavior of elements described in various namespaces.
	  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationship-xhtml-voice" id="relationship-xhtml-voice"></a>1.3.13 XHTML + Voice</h4><p>The XHTML+Voice profile is designed for Web clients that
	  support visual and spoken interaction. The XHTML+Voice
	  profile brings spoken interaction to standard web content by
	  integrating a set of mature web technologies such as XHTML
	  and XML Events with XML vocabularies developed as part of
	  the W3C Speech Interface Framework. The profile includes
	  voice modules that support speech synthesis, speech dialogs,
	  command and control, speech grammars, and the ability to
	  attach Voice handlers for responding to specific DOM events,
	  thereby re-using the event model familiar to web
	  developers. Voice interaction features are integrated
	  directly with XHTML and CSS, and can consequently be used
	  directly within XHTML content. The definition of the
	  XHMTL+Voice profile is a compound document profile.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-soap-attachments" id="relationships-soap-attachments"></a>1.3.14 SOAP Attachments and Optimization Technologies</h4><p>SOAP Attachments provide a way to divide documents into
	  several pieces for more efficient serialization and subsequent
	  recombination. For the WG's produced recommendations,
	  SOAP Attachments are similar in scope to the XInclude technology,
	  the combining technology operates and provides semantic
	  information on top of these serialization issues.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-open-document" id="relationships-open-document"></a>1.3.15 OASIS's Open Document Format</h4><p>The OASIS effort is targeted at office productivity
	  applications, such as word processors, spreadsheets or
	  presentation authoring tools. The work is focused on
	  representing the full information contained in documents
	  that are created and edited with such tools in an
	  interoperable manner. On the other hand, the CDF effort is
	  focused on combining formats for web publication and has a
	  lot of focus on user agent environment, and runtime
	  behavior. For example, the CDF Working Group efforts will focus on issues
	  such as the runtime interaction model for documents
	  including components from different XML formats. This is not
	  addressed by the Open Document Format specification. The
	  Open Document Format, on the other hand, specifies an office
	  application compatible style model, page layouts, index
	  generations, text fields, table formulas which the CDF
	  specifications will not address.</p></div></div><div class="div2">

<h4><a name="authoringtools" id="authoringtools"></a>1.5.1 Authoring tools and content production systems</h4><p>Compound documents can be authored by a variety of means including:</p><ul><li><p>Hand editing with a text editor</p></li><li><p>Dynamic generation via a Web servers or other back end systems</p></li><li><p>Via authoring tools which focus on the component languages (an 
	    XHTML authoring tool)</p></li><li><p>Via authoring tools which focus on compound documents (a "CDF 
	    authoring tool")</p></li></ul><p>It is expected that there will be multiple categories of CDF authoring 
	  tools. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><p>Document-centric authoring tools to create content which mixes static 
	    text and graphics for the purpose of publishing on the Web</p></li><li><p>Multimedia-centric authoring tools for creating time-based, interactive

	    adapted to different user requirements and across different media</p></li></ul></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="useragents" id="useragents"></a>1.5.2 User agents, such as browsers and plug-ins</h4><p>Depending on the system, CDF content will be viewed in a variety of ways:</p><ul><li><p>Via native support within a browser which is
	    conformant with CDF specification(s)</p></li><li><p>Via a browser plug-in which registers itself as a

<h2><a name="use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>2 Use Cases</h2><p>The W3C and other bodies have created multiple XML syntaxes
      for various purposes, such as XHTML for on-line document
      viewing, SVG for 2D vector graphics, XForms for form processing 
      or SMIL for multi-media
      synchronization. While there has been a lot of interest for
      these individual solutions, there has been a growing demand for
      a solution that would let end-users use them together to define
      a single piece of content. The individual markups as those just
      mentioned have great features, but these features become even
      more compelling when combined. For example, being able to
      display scalable 2D images in XHTML pages provides the ability
      to define pages which can be printed with high
      quality. Similarly, using SVG images in an XHTML table provides
      an easy way to layout SVG images in a table.</p><p>There is a demand for letting content creators combine
      markups so as to create richer documents, containing multi-media
      information: text, forms, graphics, audio and video. For that reason,
      the main use case for the CDF activity is the definition of rich
      multimedia content, as defined in <a href="#rich_multimedia_content_definition"><b>1.2 Definition of Rich Multimedia Content</b></a>.</p><div class="div2">

<h4><a name="usecase-sync-of-html-content" id="usecase-sync-of-html-content"></a>2.6.1 Synchronization of HTML content with audio visual content:</h4><p>The description of an auction item on an auction service (a Web page)
	  includes a short video clip that describes the item. Lets
	  assume the user needs to watch the video clip in-full for
	  legal reasons before he is allowed to place a bid for this
	  item by typing the amount in an entry field and pressing the
	  "Place Bid" button on the same Web page.</p><p>User starts play-back of the video by selecting a button
	  on the page. This raises an event that starts playback of
	  the embedded video object. Once the video has ended the
	  embedded video object raises another event. This event
	  causes the "Place Bid" to become selectable in the HTML
	  page.</p><p>This use case includes several functionalities which are
	  not possible in HTML and the &lt;object&gt; element today: </p><ul><li><p>starting and stopping playback of an embedded video (or audio) in response to interaction with another HTML element</p></li><li><p>an embedded object generating an event that causes an update to the including HTML page (possibly with the help of JavaScript) without reloading this page</p></li></ul></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="usecase-animated-svg-icons" id="usecase-animated-svg-icons"></a>2.6.2 Animated SVG icons in HTML menu</h4><p>An HTML page includes a menu for the user to select
	  between different Web applications. Each menu item is a
	  single &lt;a&gt; element. Each anchor value consists of an SVG
	  graphics and a rich text label. Each SVG graphics must
	    scale to fit the same size rectangular bounding box
	    (position and size defined by the containing HTML+CSS
	    document), aspect ratio must be maintained when
	    scaling. Example:</p>

<h5><a name="reqmt-useragentidentifies" id="reqmt-useragentidentifies"></a>3.1.1.5 Each Profile MUST explain how a User Agent is able to identify it</h5><p>A CDF Profile content (that is, content which confirms to a language
    profile built using its CDF Profile specification) will be unambiguously
    identified as conforming to that language profile.</p><p>Content creators and viewer implementations will both better be
    able to meet the conformance requirements of the CDF

    CDF spec.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-eventscrossnamespace" id="reqmt-eventscrossnamespace"></a>3.1.1.9 CDF MUST support event mechanisms that cross namespace boundaries</h5><p>Define consistent rules that specify how events pass to

    when events are passed across namespace boundaries.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-scriptability" id="reqmt-scriptability"></a>3.1.1.10 CDF MUST support scriptability</h5><p>Compound documents have to support scripting languages. The scripts
    have to be able to access and modify the elements of both root and child
    documents as well as root and integrated languages.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-nestinglevel" id="reqmt-nestinglevel"></a>3.1.1.11 CDF MUST specify the allowed nesting level of combinations</h5><p>Each CDF profile must define, whether there are restrictions to
  number of nesting levels. For example, whether a referenced SVG can
  itself reference another XHTML content.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-addingeventhandlers" id="reqmt-addingeventhandlers"></a>3.1.1.12 CDF profiles SHOULD provide a method for adding event
    handlers using declarative markup for the formats it uses</h5><p>Event handlers contain instructions on how to react to certain
    event. These can be written either using a scripting language or a
    declarative (i.e., markup) language. The CDF specification should
    provide a method to add event handlers both to parent and child
    documents or languages. If a CDF profile contains a markup language that
    supports declarative event handlers then the CDF profile should
    also support event handlers defined using markup.
    </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-transport" id="reqmt-transport"></a>3.1.1.13 CDF must define its integration into the Web
    Architecture. It must include delivery over HTTP and should also
    strive to be transport independent</h5><p>CDF profile documents must describe how they integrate into the
    Web Architecture, particularly in the areas of media types and
    transfer/transport protocols.  It must be described how this works
    with HTTP as well as other protocols typically used to transfer
    Web content (e.g., RTP).</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-compression" id="reqmt-compression"></a>3.1.1.14 CDF MUST NOT prevent compression of the data</h5><p>For efficiency, user agents and other renderers must support
    served content that is compressed in whole or part.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-richmultimedia" id="reqmt-richmultimedia"></a>3.1.1.15 CDF MUST provide the ability for content developers to describe
   or author rich media content</h5><p>Rich Multimedia Content is defined in <a href="#rich_multimedia_content_definition"><b>1.2 Definition of Rich Multimedia Content</b></a>.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-temporalsync" id="reqmt-temporalsync"></a>3.1.1.16 
      CDF MUST support temporal synchronization of dynamic content
      coming from multiple references, possibly with multiple
      references to the same source.</h5><p>Support the synchronization of multiple instances of
    dynamic content, such as animations, audio and video, within a
    single compound document.

<h5><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-links" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-links"></a>3.1.1.17 CDF profiles MUST specify how focus traversal works with
    compounding documents and languages.</h5><p>For example, when an XHTML document references an SVG document,
    what is the relation between the XHTML document's focus traversal
    and the SVG document's focus traversal. How does the SVG document
    get focus and how does the focus traversal starts in the SVG
    document? How does it end?
    </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-animations" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-animations"></a>3.1.1.18 CDF profiles MUST specify triggering of animations across namespaces.</h5><p>For example, if an XHTML document references an SVG document,
    the profile MUST specify how an SVG animation can be triggered by
    an XHTML event target.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-accessibility" id="reqmt-accessibility"></a>3.1.1.19 CDF documents MUST cater for accessibility requirements</h5><p>All CDF profiles must take accessibility requirements in
    consideration. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web
    Accessibility Initiative</a> has defined Web Accessibility
    Guidelines, which must be used when CDF profiles are developed. In
    addition, markup language specific accessibility guidelines have
    been defined in Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines document. A CDF profile must support all the techniques
    that are supported by the markup language modules included in
    it. The same applies for the authoring tool accessibility
    guidelines and the user agent accessibility guidelines.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-dynamicupdating" id="reqmt-dynamicupdating"></a>3.1.1.20 CDF documents MUST support dynamic updating</h5><p>Dynamic documents and languages can be manipulated by scripts, etc. The user
    interaction can fire events, which are caught by event
    handlers. The event handlers can then manipulate the elements via
    the DOM interface. These changes are then displayed to the
    user. CDF markups must support dynamic updating across different
    compounding markups.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-unified-key-handling-across-CD" id="reqmt-unified-key-handling-across-CD"></a>3.1.1.21 CDF MUST define the way soft-keys and accesskeys are handled across document and language components</h5><p>
      For instance, what happens when there is a conflict between 2 accesskeys 
      which have the same value but are supposed to trigger different actions
      in the parent and in the child documents.
    </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-fonts" id="reqmt-fonts"></a>3.1.1.22 CDR User Agents MUST provide a default font for use by all components</h5><p>Standalone components or renderers, such as SVGT engines, do not 
    always provide a default system font.</p><p>A CDR User Agent, however, must at least provide one default system 
    font to all components, such as browsers, SVG engines and other renderers.</p><p>The CDR specification cannot mandate any particular font, nor font 
    technology. But it mandates the availability of 'a' default font, so 
    that content providers can print text in any component or render as 
    simply as this can be done in XHTML.</p><p>The default system font may be bitmap based, antialiased or a 
    vector font. Ideally, the same default system font should be used for 
    all components.</p>
<h5><a name="code-reqmt-fonts" id="code-reqmt-fonts"></a>The following SVG sample markup MUST generate visible text.</h5><table class="scrap" summary="Scrap"><tbody><tr><td><pre>&lt;svg ...&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-serversideadaptation" id="reqmt-serversideadaptation"></a>3.1.1.23 CDF MUST NOT prevent server-side adaptation</h5><p>Some animations could be too heavy for some terminals - or
    could be too 'unsophisticated' for others.</p><p>Server side adaptation must therefore be possible in order to
    support less capable devices. For example, it should be possible
    for a server to determine the SVG capabilities of the device (such
    as the rendering and animation capabilities.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-limitedbandwidth" id="reqmt-limitedbandwidth"></a>3.1.1.24 CDF MUST support limited bandwidth networks and limited
    capability devices</h5><p>Small footprint and mobile devices often are connected to
    mobile networks, characterized by comparatively low bandwidth
    and/or high connection latency. Additionally, mobile networks may
    charge users for data downloaded. It is therefore desirable to
    ensure that this bandwidth is used optimally.</p><p>Authoring tools and/or systems serving CDF documents must be
    able to use techniques to reduce size of materials transmitted and
    the latency involved.

    root document and the possible child documents.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-elementused" id="reqmt-elementused"></a>3.1.2.3 CDR MUST specify, for each format, the element used to
    reference other formats, if any.</h5><p>For example, the CDR
    specification will specify that the XHTML &lt;object&gt; element is to
    be used for formats included in XHTML, and will specify the
    usage of this element to include other formats.</p><p>It may be necessary to transfer some parameters declaratively 
    to a child document. Each CDR profile MAY specify a list of pre-defined 
    parameters/values for the &lt;object&gt; element. For instance, for CDR WP1, 
    there could be these kind of parameters/values:</p>

<h5><a name="reqmt-scriptingbetweencomponents" id="reqmt-scriptingbetweencomponents"></a>3.1.2.4 CDR MUST explain how scripting interacts between components and the parent document</h5><p>CDR profile documents must explain what kind of access, if any,
    scripts have between the parent and child documents and
    vice-versa.  Can a script in a child document access its parent's
    DOM, and if so, how?  Can a script in a parent document access a
    child's DOM?  If there is access, the mechanism must be described.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-focus" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-focus"></a>3.1.2.5 CDR profiles MUST specify how event propagation works
    across namespace boundaries.</h5><p>CDF profile documents must explain how, if at all, events get
    propagated from parent to child documents and vice-versa.  Do
    events from a parent document get propagated to the children
    documents?  Do events from a child document get propagated to the
    parent document?</p><p>For example, if an XHTML document references an SVG document,
    what is the event propagation model when the user activates an SVG
    element? Do events bubble from a child document to the referencing
    parent document? Does event capture happen from the root of the
    referenced document or does it happen from the root of the
    referencing document? This event propagation model MUST be
    consistent with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events">DOM Level 3 event
    model</a>.

<h5><a name="reqmt-link-activation" id="reqmt-link-activation"></a>3.1.2.6 CDR profiles MUST specify how link activation work with
    referenced document.</h5><p>A referenced object may be wrapped with a XHTML anchor.
    A referenced object may contain it's own embedded links.
    A referenced object may be wrapped with a XHTML anchor and 
    contain it's own embedded links.</p><p>In addition, a referenced object may draw it's own visual 
    feedback for focus activation and/or mouse-over.</p><p>CDR must specify all these cases, since they may require different 
    handling, depending on the type of user interaction: pointing device 
    or joystick operation.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-fragmentIDs" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-fragmentIDs"></a>3.1.2.7 CDR MUST support fragment identifiers in cross-namespace
    interaction</h5><p>In CDR, child documents within a parent document are referenced
    with URI references.  This URI reference must support also
    so-called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#fragid">fragment
    identifiers</a>. Each fragment identifier is passed to the
    component or plug-in that displays the child document, when the
    documents are loaded. The handling of the fragment identifiers
    depends on the MIME type of the child document.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-currentLoadingStatus" id="reqmt-currentLoadingStatus"></a>3.1.2.8 CDR Profiles SHOULD provide a way to know the current loading status of a
referenced component</h5><p>Sometimes, one or several medias are needed before the end-user can
interact with a RichMedia application : for instance, a list of small
audio clips must be downloaded in an interactive game before the
end-user can start playing. Or some small audio clips must be downloaded
before the application can provide speech instructions in a navigation
system ("turn left", "turn right", ...). As a result, CDR should explain
a way to know whether a referenced component is currently loading, has
successfully been loaded or failed to be loaded and launch appropriate
actions accordingly.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-packaging-static" id="reqmt-packaging-static"></a>3.1.2.9 CDR MUST provide a solution for packaging of self-contained, static content</h5><p>Packaging is needed in order to support optimization of the

       dispatching of component languages within compound documents.  User 
       agents must be able to register for a specific namespace and be invoked 
       when nodes from the associated component language are encountered.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt_fwk_cdi_dom_apis" id="reqmt_fwk_cdi_dom_apis"></a>3.1.3.3 CDI Profiles MUST define which DOM interfaces are implemented</h5><p>A CDI Profile must define which DOM interfaces are implemented by the  
       document object representing the document.  Component languages may have
       their on specialized DOM interfaces based on associated MIME types or

<h5><a name="reqmt-userinteractionmodel" id="reqmt-userinteractionmodel"></a>3.2.1.2 WICD Profiles MUST specify a user interaction model</h5><p>WICD Profiles must support a clear user interaction model between
   	components (event/focus management). Interactivity between
   	components will help to provide a seamless and compelling user
   	experience of documents which combine XHTML and media
   	elements.

<h5><a name="reqmt-scalablegraphics" id="reqmt-scalablegraphics"></a>3.2.1.3 WICD Profiles MUST support 2D scalable vector graphics</h5><p>
      2D Scalable vector graphics are required in order to easily deploy the
      same user interface onto multiple devices with different screen
      sizes / shapes and resolutions.
    </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-audio" id="reqmt-audio"></a>3.2.1.4 WICD Profiles MUST support audio</h5><p>User agents must support the ability to play audio while rendering content.  For example, a rendered document may choose to play music while the document is displayed.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-video" id="reqmt-video"></a>3.2.1.5 WICD Profiles SHOULD support video</h5><p>User agents should support the ability to play video while rendering content.  For example, a rendered document may choose to play a video clip while the document is displayed.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-layouts" id="reqmt-layouts"></a>3.2.1.6 WICD Profiles MUST support grid, flow, overlapping layouts</h5><p>In order to create rich content document, content authors need the 
ability to position and layout information items or user interface 
components. This is crucial authoring feature which also allows content 
to adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratio. Layout is a 
complement to the scalable nature to formats such as SVG. In WICD Profiles 
, grid and flow layouts MUST be supported. Overlapping layout, i.e., 
the ability to layout component that overlap completely or partially, 
MUST also be supported.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-XHTMLasroot" id="reqmt-XHTMLasroot"></a>3.2.1.7 WICD Profiles MUST support XHTML as a root/host language</h5><p>However it is not necessarily the only root hosting language.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-animatedSVGicons" id="reqmt-animatedSVGicons"></a>3.2.1.8 WICD Profiles MUST define for animated SVG icons to act like HTML
   images (no need for interactivity, links, zoom and pan)</h5><p>
   When used as background images, it is complex and most often irrelevant to
   provide interaction, such as zooming, panning, linking and mouse events
   processing, with the SVG graphics. However, animation makes senses in that
   it can provide decorative value.
   </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-focusevents" id="reqmt-focusevents"></a>3.2.1.9 WICD Profiles MUST define a way for events to trigger SVG
   animation</h5><p>This is required in order to support pleasing
   button animation on select and activate events, such as focus
   events, beyond the current "on/off" capability in
   CSS</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-realestatenegotiation" id="reqmt-realestatenegotiation"></a>3.2.1.10 WICD Profiles MUST define the process for real-estate negotiation
   between an XHTML document and a referenced SVG document</h5><p>WICD Profiles will provide comprehensive, mandatory rules that
   specify how document components from different XML vocabularies are
   scaled when they occur within other components
   (right-sizing). Support the ability for relative size measures
   to be used by authors. Ensure that rules define the behavior
   when fixed and relative sized components are used together
   within a single document. Ensure that the rules define the
   behavior associated with areas of the containing component
   not filled by the contained component. Thus, it will be
   possible to create truly screen size-independent content.
   </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-leftovers" id="reqmt-leftovers"></a>3.2.1.11 WICD Profiles MUST define handling of leftover SVG area</h5><p>Rendering SVG content in a fixed-sized area often
    results in visible areas outside of the SVG viewbox.  How these areas
    are filled must be defined.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-systemfontsupport" id="reqmt-systemfontsupport"></a>3.2.1.12 WICD Profiles MUST define system font support in SVG</h5><p>SVGT does not mandate system fonts, but in the context of a
      user agent, highly optimized system fonts are available. On many
      devices (when executed in the context of a user agent), highly
      optimized fonts are available. </p><p>It is therefore necessary to make highly optimized terminal
      fonts (used by the user agent) available to SVG as system fonts and
      to support the ability for common font sets to be used
      throughout the combined document. In particular, platform fonts
      should be able to be used if supported, with support font fall-back
      mechanisms to provide defaults in the event that chosen fonts
      are unavailable. The SVG &lt;text&gt; element should always display
      something as long as it is within the viewport.</p><p>Related to CDR requirement: <a href="#reqmt-fonts"><b>3.1.1.22 CDR User Agents MUST provide a default font for use by all components</b></a>.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-unifiedrendering" id="reqmt-unifiedrendering"></a>3.2.1.13 WICD Profiles MUST support a unified rendering and processing model</h5><p>Ensure that rendering is consistent across all components of a
    WICD Profile document. In particular, ensure that there are suitable
    rules that define how z-ordering applies between different
    components which may overlay one another. Also ensure that there
    are rules that define how transparency is handled when components
    overlay one another. CSS z-ordering may provide a mechanism for
    controlling this.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-transparency" id="reqmt-transparency"></a>3.2.1.14 WICD Profiles MUST support SVG backgrounds</h5><p>A WICD user agent MUST support static SVG background images and
    MAY support animated or scripted SVG background images. Authors
    however should not assume that the latter functionality will be
    available.
    </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-transparency2" id="reqmt-transparency2"></a>3.2.1.15 WICD Profiles MAY support XHTML backgrounds</h5><p>A WICD user agent MAY support compositing above an XHTML document defined as a background image.
    </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-scalablediagrams" id="reqmt-scalablediagrams"></a>3.2.1.16 WICD Profiles MUST support scalable diagrams that can be animated
  	and can cause link traversal</h5><p>An example of usage is the implementation of buttons which render
	their own visual feedback (animated buttons for
	navigation). These will provide a scalable alternative to the
	use of images as the source of links that can be
	traversed. These should be allowed to contain animation, but
	not rich interaction.

<h5><a name="reqmt-temportal-start-and-stop" id="reqmt-temportal-start-and-stop"></a>3.2.1.17 WICD Profiles SHOULD provide temporal synchronization with dynamic media</h5><p>The Profile should be able to synchronize events with the start and end of playback of dynamic media objects, such as a video or audio stream.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-stop-and-start-media" id="reqmt-stop-and-start-media"></a>3.2.1.18 WICD Profiles MAY provide functionality to stop and start media objects</h5><p>The Profile may include mechanisms to start playback of dynamic content (from the start of a stream) and to stop playback (with automatic rewind).</p></div></div><div class="div3">

<h5><a name="reqmt-xhtmlsvginteractionmodel" id="reqmt-xhtmlsvginteractionmodel"></a>3.2.2.4 CDR Profile 1 MUST define the interaction model for an SVG
   document referenced by an XHTML document</h5><p>To ensure interoperability, it is important that the CDR Profile 1 
specification defines the interaction model for SVG documents referenced 
by XHTML documents. For example, the interaction model must define if 
and how interaction with an SVG document requires activation, or if 
activation is optional, how activation is controlled. By the same token, 
the interaction model should define the precedence rules between the SVG 
content and the referencing XHTML document, for example regarding 
hyperlinking: if an XHTML &lt;object&gt; is enclosed in an &lt;a&gt; element and the
&lt;object&gt; references an SVG document which itself displays anchors, what 
is the behavior when clicking over one of the anchors in the SVG element?</p><p>See also <a href="#reqmt-userinteractionmodel"><b>3.2.1.2 WICD Profiles MUST specify a user interaction model</b></a></p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-animationOnLoad" id="reqmt-animationOnLoad"></a>3.2.2.5 CDR Profile 1 SHOULD provide a way to play an animation while some

one or several parts of the combined document are loading. For instance,
this can be a progress bar informing the end-user about the loading
progress or an advertising which plays while some audio/video content is
being fetched.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="reqmt-audiomixing" id="reqmt-audiomixing"></a>3.2.2.6 CDR Profile 1 MUST specify the behavior of audio mixing</h5><p>CDR Profile 1 must specify how user agents behave when multiple

       default behavior of interpreting and presenting the content) modes. The 
       framework must define a common vocabulary of modes that is sufficient to 
       describe the behaviors of existing document format specifications. 
       Document format specifications (or, for existing document formats,
