    <p>
      The OWL Web Ontology Language is designed for use by
      applications that need to process the content of information
      instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL
      facilitates greater machine interpretability of Web content
      than that supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by
      providing additional vocabulary along with a formal
      semantics. OWL has three increasingly-expressive
      sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is written for readers who want a first
      impression of the capabilities of OWL. It provides an
      introduction to OWL by informally describing the features of
      each of the sublanguages of OWL. Some knowledge of
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#ref-rdf-schema">
      RDF Schema</a> is useful for understanding this document, but
      not essential. After this document, interested readers may
      turn to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/">OWL
      Guide</a> for more detailed descriptions and extensive
      examples on the features of OWL. The normative formal
      definition of OWL can be found in the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/">OWL Semantics
      and Abstract Syntax</a>.

    <h2>
      <a id="s1" name="s1"></a>1. Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document describes the OWL Web Ontology Language. OWL is
      intended to be used when the information contained in
      documents needs to be processed by applications, as opposed
      to situations where the content only needs to be presented to
      humans. OWL can be used to explicitly represent the meaning
      of terms in vocabularies and the relationships between those
      terms. This representation of terms and their
      interrelationships is called an ontology. OWL has more
      facilities for expressing meaning and semantics than XML,
      RDF, and RDF-S, and thus OWL goes beyond these languages in
      its ability to represent machine interpretable content on the
      Web. OWL is a revision of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#DAMLReference">
      DAML+OIL web ontology language</a> incorporating lessons
      learned from the design and application of DAML+OIL.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a id="s1.1" name="s1.1"></a>1.1 Document Roadmap
    </h3>
    <p>
      The OWL Language is described by a set of documents, each
      fulfilling a different purpose, and catering to a different
      audience. The following provides a brief roadmap for
      navigating through this set of documents:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL
        Overview</a> gives a simple introduction to OWL by
        providing a language feature listing with very brief
        feature descriptions;
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/">OWL Guide</a>
        demonstrates the use of the OWL language by providing an
        extended example. It also provides a
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#OWLGlossary">glossary</a>
        of the terminology used in these documents;
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL
        Reference</a> gives a systematic and compact (but still
        informally stated) description of all the modelling
        primitives of OWL;
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/">OWL
        Semantics and Abstract Syntax</a> document is the final and
        formally stated normative definition of the language;
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-test/">OWL Web
        Ontology Language Test Cases</a> document contains a large
        set of test cases for the language;
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/">OWL Use
        Cases and Requirements</a> document contains a set of use
        cases for a web ontology language and compiles a set of
        requirements for OWL.
      </li>
    </ul>The suggested reading order of the first four documents is
    as given since they have been listed in increasing degree of
    technical content. The last two documents complete the
    documentation set. 
    <h3>
      <a id="s1.2" name="s1.2"></a>1.2 Why OWL?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Semantic Web is a vision for the future of the Web in
      which information is given explicit meaning, making it easier
      for machines to automatically process and integrate
      information available on the Web. The Semantic Web will build
      on XML's ability to define customized tagging schemes and
      RDF's flexible approach to representing data. The first level
      above RDF required for the Semantic Web is an ontology
      language what can formally describe the meaning of
      terminology used in Web documents. If machines are expected
      to perform useful reasoning tasks on these documents, the
      language must go beyond the basic semantics of RDF Schema.
      The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/">OWL Use Cases
      and Requirements Document</a> provides more
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/#onto-def">details
      on ontologies</a>, motivates the need for a Web Ontology
      Language in terms of
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/#section-use-cases">six
      use cases</a>, and formulates
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/#section-goals">design
      goals</a>,
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/#section-requirements">
      requirements</a> and
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/#section-objectives">
      objectives</a> for OWL.
    </p>
    <p>
      OWL has been designed to meet this need for a Web Ontology
      Language. OWL is part of the growing stack of W3C
      recommendations related to the Semantic Web.

          <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> provides a

          OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and
          classes: among others, relations between classes (e.g.
          disjointness), cardinality (e.g. "exactly one"),
          equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics of
          properties (e.g. symmetry), and enumerated classes.

      OWL
    </h3>
    <p>
      OWL provides three increasingly expressive sublanguages
      designed for use by specific communities of implementers and
      users.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a id="term_OWLLite" name="term_OWLLite"></a><em>OWL
          Lite</em> supports those users primarily needing a
          classification hierarchy and simple constraints. For
          example, while it supports cardinality constraints, it
          only permits cardinality values of 0 or 1. It should be
          simpler to provide tool support for OWL Lite than its
          more expressive relatives, and OWL Lite provides a quick
          migration path for thesauri and other taxonomies. Owl
          Lite also has a lower formal complexity than OWL DL, see
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#OWLLite">the
          section on OWL Lite in the OWL Reference</a> for further
          details.

      </li>

        <p>
          <a id="term_OWLDL" name="term_OWLDL"></a><em>OWL DL</em>
          supports those users who want the maximum expressiveness
          while retaining computational completeness (all
          conclusions are guaranteed to be computable) and
          decidability (all computations will finish in finite
          time). OWL DL includes all OWL language constructs, but
          they can be used only under certain restrictions (for
          example, while a class may be a subclass of many classes,
          a class cannot be an instance of another class).

          Full</em> is meant for users who want maximum
          expressiveness and the syntactic freedom of RDF with no
          computational guarantees. For example, in OWL Full a
          class can be treated simultaneously as a collection of
          individuals and as an individual in its own right. OWL
          Full allows an ontology to augment the meaning of the
          pre-defined (RDF or OWL) vocabulary. It is unlikely that
          any reasoning software will be able to support complete
          reasoning for every feature of OWL Full.

      </li>

    <p>
      Each of these sublanguages is an extension of its simpler
      predecessor, both in what can be legally expressed and in

      hold. Their inverses do not.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Every legal OWL Lite ontology is a legal OWL DL ontology.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every legal OWL DL ontology is a legal OWL Full ontology.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every valid OWL Lite conclusion is a valid OWL DL
        conclusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every valid OWL DL conclusion is a valid OWL Full
        conclusion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ontology developers adopting OWL should consider which
      sublanguage best suits their needs. The choice between OWL
      Lite and OWL DL depends on the extent to which users require
      the more-expressive constructs provided by OWL DL. The choice
      between OWL DL and OWL Full mainly depends on the extent to
      which users require the meta-modeling facilities of RDF
      Schema (e.g. defining classes of classes, or attaching
      properties to classes). When using OWL Full as compared to
      OWL DL, reasoning support is less predictable since complete
      OWL Full implementations do not currently exist.
    </p>OWL Full can be viewed as an extension of RDF, while OWL
    Lite and OWL DL can be viewed as extensions of a restricted
    view of RDF. Every OWL (Lite, DL, Full) document is an RDF
    document, and every RDF document is an OWL Full document, but
    only some RDF documents will be a legal OWL Lite or OWL DL
    document. Because of this, some care has to be taken when a
    user wants to migrate an RDF document to OWL. When the
    expressiveness of OWL DL or OWL Lite is deemed appropriate,
    some precautions have to be taken to ensure that the original
    RDF document complies with the additional constraints imposed
    by OWL DL and OWL Lite. Among others, every URI that is used as
    a class name must be explicitly asserted to be of type
    owl:Class (and similarly for properties), every individual must
    be asserted to belong to at least one class (even if only
    owl:Thing), the URI's used for classes, properties and
    individuals must be mutually disjoint. The details of these and
    other constraints on OWL DL and OWL Lite are explained in
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#app-DLinRDF">appendix E
    of the OWL Reference</a>.

    </h3>
    <p>
      This document first describes the features in OWL Lite,
      followed by a description of the features that are added in
      OWL DL and OWL Full (OWL DL and OWL Full contain the same
      features, but OWL Full is more liberal about how these
      features can be combined).

    <h2>
      <a id="s2" name="s2"></a>2. Language Synopsis
    </h2>This section provides a quick index to all the language
    features for OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. 
    <p>
      In this document, italicized terms are terms in OWL. Prefixes
      of rdf: or rdfs: are used when terms are already present in
      RDF or RDF Schema. Otherwise terms are introduced by OWL.
      Thus, the term <i>rdfs:subPropertyOf</i> indicates that
      subPropertyOf is already in the rdfs vocabulary (technically
      : the rdfs namespace). Also, the term <i>Class</i> is more
      precisely stated as <i>owl:Class</i> and is a term introduced
      by OWL.

    <h2>
      <a id="s3" name="s3"></a>3. Language Description of OWL Lite
    </h2>
    <p>
      This section provides an informal description of the OWL Lite
      language features. We do not discuss the specific syntax of
      these features (see the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL Reference</a> for
      definitions). Each language feature is hyperlinked to the
      appropriate place in the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/">OWL Guide</a> for
      more examples and guidance on usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      OWL Lite uses only some of the OWL language features and has
      more limitations on the use of the features than OWL DL or
      OWL Full. For example, in OWL Lite classes can only be
      defined in terms of named superclasses (superclasses cannot
      be arbitrary expressions), and only certain kinds of class
      restrictions can be used. Equivalence between classes and
      subclass relationships between classes are also only allowed
      between named classes, and not between arbitrary class
      expressions. Similarly, restrictions in OWL Lite use only
      named classes. OWL Lite also has a limited notion of
      cardinality - the only cardinalities allowed to be explicitly
      stated are 0 or 1.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a id="s3.1" name="s3.1"></a>3.1 OWL Lite RDF Schema Features
    </h3><!-- FvH: now obsolete because of term glossary in Guide
                    This document uses the term "individual" to refer 
                    to objects that belong to classes (e.g., the individual Deborah belongs to the 
                    class Person) as well as to objects that are datatypes (e.g., the individual 4 is an integer).
                    -->
    <p>
      The following OWL Lite features related to RDF Schema are
      included.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="Class"
        name="Class"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_Class">
        Class</a></i></b>: A class defines a group of individuals
        that belong together because they share some properties.
        For example, Deborah and Frank are both members of the
        class Person. Classes can be organized in a specialization
        hierarchy using
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#subClassOf">
        <i>subClassOf</i></a>. There is a built-in most general
        class named
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#DefiningSimpleClasses">
        Thing</a> that is the class of all individuals and is a
        superclass of all OWL classes. There is also a built-in
        most specific class named
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#DefiningSimpleClasses">
        Nothing</a> that is the class that has no instances and a
        subclass of all OWL classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="subClassOf"
        name="subClassOf"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#rdfs_subClassOf">
        rdfs:subClassOf</a></i></b>: Class hierarchies may be
        created by making one or more statements that a class is a
        subclass of another class. For example, the class Person
        could be stated to be a subclass of the class Mammal. From
        this a reasoner can deduce that if an individual is a
        Person, then it is also a Mammal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="property"
        name="property"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#DefiningProperties">
        rdf:Property</a></i></b>: Properties can be used to state
        relationships between individuals or from individuals to
        data values. Examples of properties include hasChild,
        hasRelative, hasSibling, and hasAge. The first three can be
        used to relate an instance of a class Person to another
        instance of the class Person (and are thus occurences of
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#DefiningProperties">
        ObjectProperty</a>), and the last (hasAge) can be used to
        relate an instance of the class Person to an instance of
        the datatype Integer (and is thus an occurence of
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#DefiningProperties">
        DatatypeProperty</a>). Both owl:ObjectProperty and
        owl:DatatypeProperty are
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#ObjectProperty-def">subclasses</a>
        of the RDF class rdf:Property.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="subPropertyOf"
        name="subPropertyOf"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#rdfs_subPropertyOf">
        rdfs:subPropertyOf</a></i></b>: Property hierarchies may be
        created by making one or more statements that a property is
        a subproperty of one or more other properties. For example,
        hasSibling may be stated to be a subproperty of
        hasRelative. From this a reasoner can deduce that if an
        individual is related to another by the hasSibling
        property, then it is also related to the other by the
        hasRelative property.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="domain"
        name="domain"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#term_domain">
        rdfs:domain</a></i></b>: A domain of a property limits the
        individuals to which the property can be applied. If a
        property relates an individual to another individual, and
        the property has a class as one of its domains, then the
        individual must belong to the class. For example, the
        property hasChild may be stated to have the domain of
        Mammal. From this a reasoner can deduce that if Frank
        hasChild Anna, then Frank must be a Mammal. Note that
        <i>rdfs:domain</i> is called a global restriction since the
        restriction is stated on the property and not just on the
        property when it is associated with a particular class. See
        the discussion below on property restrictions for more
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="range"
        name="range"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#term_range">
        rdfs:range</a></i></b>: The range of a property limits the
        individuals that the property may have as its value. If a
        property relates an individual to another individual, and
        the property has a class as its range, then the other
        individual must belong to the range class. For example, the
        property hasChild may be stated to have the range of
        Mammal. From this a reasoner can deduce that if Louise is
        related to Deborah by the hasChild property, (i.e., Deborah
        is the child of Louise), then Deborah is a Mammal. Range is
        also a global restriction as is domain above. Again, see
        the discussion below on local restrictions (e.g.
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#allValuesFrom">
        AllValuesFrom</a>) for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#term_individual">
        Individual</a><a id="Individual"
        name="Individual"></a></i></b> : Individuals are instances
        of classes, and properties may be used to relate one
        individual to another. For example, an individual named
        Deborah may be described as an instance of the class Person
        and the property hasEmployer may be used to relate the
        individual Deborah to the individual StanfordUniversity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <a id="s3.2" name="s3.2"></a>3.2 OWL Lite Equality and
      Inequality
    </h3>The following OWL Lite features are related to equality or
    inequality. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><i><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_equivalentClass">
        equivalentClass</a><a id="equivalentClass"
        name="equivalentClass"></a></i></b> : Two classes may be
        stated to be equivalent. Equivalent classes have the same
        instances. Equality can be used to create synonymous
        classes. For example, Car can be stated to be
        <i>equivalentClass</i> to Automobile. From this a reasoner
        can deduce that any individual that is an instance of Car
        is also an instance of Automobile and vice versa.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="equivalentProperty"
        name="equivalentProperty"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_equivalentProperty">
        equivalentProperty</a></i></b>: Two properties may be
        stated to be equivalent. Equivalent properties relate one
        individual to the same set of other individuals. Equality
        may be used to create synonymous properties. For example,
        hasLeader may be stated to be the <i>equivalentProperty</i>
        to hasHead. From this a reasoner can deduce that if X is
        related to Y by the property hasLeader, X is also related
        to Y by the property hasHead and vice versa. A reasoner can
        also deduce that hasLeader is a subproperty of hasHead and
        hasHead is a subProperty of hasLeader.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a id="sameAs"
        name="sameAs"></a><b><i><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_sameAs">
        sameAs</a></i></b>: Two individuals may be stated to be the
        same. These constructs may be used to create a number of
        different names that refer to the same individual. For
        example, the individual Deborah may be stated to be the
        same individual as DeborahMcGuinness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="differentFrom"
        name="differentFrom"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#differentFrom">
        differentFrom</a></i></b>: An individual may be stated to
        be different from other individuals. For example, the
        individual Frank may be stated to be different from the
        individuals Deborah and Jim. Thus, if the individuals Frank
        and Deborah are both values for a property that is stated
        to be functional (thus the property has at most one value),
        then there is a contradiction. Explicitly stating that
        individuals are different can be important in when using
        languages such as OWL (and RDF) that do not assume that
        individuals have one and only one name. For example, with
        no additional information, a reasoner will not deduce that
        Frank and Deborah refer to distinct individuals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="AllDifferent"
        name="AllDifferent"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_AllDifferent">
        AllDifferent</a></i></b>: A number of individuals may be
        stated to be mutually distinct in one AllDifferent
        statement. For example, Frank, Deborah, and Jim could be
        stated to be mutually distinct using the AllDifferent
        construct. Unlike the differentFrom statement above, this
        would also enforce that Jim and Deborah are distinct (not
        just that Frank is distinct from Deborah and Frank is
        distinct from Jim). The AllDifferent construct is
        particularly useful when there are sets of distinct objects
        and when modelers are interested in enforcing the unique
        names assumption within those sets of objects. It is used
        in conjunction with
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_distinctMembers">
        distinctMembers</a> to state that all members of a list are
        distinct and pairwise disjoint.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <a id="s3.3" name="s3.3"></a>3.3 OWL Lite Property
      Characteristics
    </h3>There are special identifiers in OWL Lite that are used to
    provide information concerning properties and their values. The
    distinction between ObjectProperty and DatatypeProperty is
    mentioned
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#property">
    above</a> in the property description. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="inverseOf"
        name="inverseOf"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_inverseOf">
        inverseOf</a></i></b>: One property may be stated to be the
        inverse of another property. If the property P1 is stated
        to be the inverse of the property P2, then if X is related
        to Y by the P2 property, then Y is related to X by the P1
        property. For example, if hasChild is the inverse of
        hasParent and Deborah hasParent Louise, then a reasoner can
        deduce that Louise hasChild Deborah.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="TransitiveProperty"
        name="TransitiveProperty"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_TransitiveProperty">
        TransitiveProperty</a></i></b>: Properties may be stated to
        be transitive. If a property is transitive, then if the
        pair (x,y) is an instance of the transitive property P, and
        the pair (y,z) is an instance of P, then the pair (x,z) is
        also an instance of P. For example, if ancestor is stated
        to be transitive, and if Sara is an ancestor of Louise
        (i.e., (Sara,Louise) is an instance of the property
        ancestor) and Louise is an ancestor of Deborah (i.e.,
        (Louise,Deborah) is an instance of the property ancestor),
        then a reasoner can deduce that Sara is an ancestor of
        Deborah (i.e., (Sara,Deborah) is an instance of the
        property ancestor).<br />
        OWL Lite (and OWL DL) impose the side condition that
        transitive properties (and their superproperties) cannot
        have a maxCardinality 1 restriction. Without this

        (x,y) is an instance of the symmetric property P, then the
        pair (y,x) is also an instance of P. For example, friend

        FunctionalProperty, then it has no more than one value for
        each individual (it may have no values for an individual).
        This characteristic has been referred to as having a unique

        the property's minimum cardinality is zero and its maximum
        cardinality is 1. For example, hasPrimaryEmployer may be
        stated to be a FunctionalProperty. From this a reasoner may
        deduce that no individual may have more than one primary
        employer. This does not imply that every Person must have

        Thus the inverse of the property has at most one value for
        each individual. This characteristic has also been referred
        to as an unambiguous property. For example,
        hasUSSocialSecurityNumber (a unique identifier for United
        States residents) may be stated to be inverse functional
        (or unambiguous). The inverse of this property (which may
        be referred to as isTheSocialSecurityNumberFor) has at most
        one value for any individual in the class of social
        security numbers. Thus any one person's social security
        number is the only value for their
        isTheSocialSecurityNumberFor property. From this a reasoner
        can deduce that no two different individual instances of
        Person have the identical US Social Security Number. Also,
        a reasoner can deduce that if two instances of Person have
        the same social security number, then those two instances
        refer to the same individual.

      <a id="s3.4" name="s3.4"></a>3.4 OWL Lite Property
      Restrictions
    </h3>OWL Lite allows restrictions to be placed on how
    properties can be used by instances of a class. These type (and
    the cardinality restrictions in the next subsection) are used
    within the context of an
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#PropertyRestrictions">owl:Restriction</a>.
    The
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#PropertyRestrictions">owl:onProperty</a>
    element indicates the restricted property. The following two
    restrictions limit which values can be used while the next
    section's restrictions limit how many values can be used. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="allValuesFrom"
        name="allValuesFrom"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_allValuesFrom">
        allValuesFrom</a></i></b>: The restriction allValuesFrom is
        stated on a property with respect to a class. It means that
        this property on this particular class has a local range
        restriction associated with it. Thus if an instance of the
        class is related by the property to a second individual,
        then the second individual can be inferred to be an
        instance of the local range restriction class. For example,
        the class Person may have a property called hasDaughter
        restricted to have allValuesFrom the class Woman. This
        means that if an individual person Louise is related by the
        property hasDaughter to the individual Deborah, then from
        this a reasoner can deduce that Deborah is an instance of
        the class Woman. This restriction allows the property
        hasDaughter to be used with other classes, such as the
        class Cat, and have an appropriate value restriction
        associated with the use of the property on that class. In
        this case, hasDaughter would have the local range
        restriction of Cat when associated with the class Cat and
        would have the local range restriction Person when
        associated with the class Person. Note that a reasoner can
        not deduce from an allValuesFrom restriction alone that
        there actually is at least one value for the property.

        someValuesFrom</a></i></b>: The restriction
        <i>someValuesFrom</i> is stated on a property with respect
        to a class. A particular class may have a restriction on a
        property that at least one value for that property is of a
        certain type. For example, the class SemanticWebPaper may
        have a <i>someValuesFrom</i> restriction on the hasKeyword
        property that states that <u>some</u> value for the
        hasKeyword property should be an instance of the class
        SemanticWebTopic. This allows for the option of having
        multiple keywords and as long as one or more is an instance
        of the class SemanticWebTopic, then the paper would be
        consistent with the <i>someValuesFrom</i> restriction.
        Unlike <i>allValuesFrom</i>, <i>someValuesFrom</i> does not
        restrict all the values of the property to be instances of
        the same class. If myPaper is an instance of the
        SemanticWebPaper class, then myPaper is related by the
        <i>hasKeyword</i> property to at least one instance of the
        SemanticWebTopic class. Note that a reasoner can not deduce
        (as it could with <i>allValuesFrom</i> restrictions) that

      <a id="s3.5" name="s3.5"></a>3.5 OWL Lite Restricted
      Cardinality
    </h3>
    <p>
      OWL Lite includes a limited form of cardinality restrictions.
      OWL (and OWL Lite) cardinality restrictions are referred to
      as local restrictions, since they are stated on properties
      with respect to a particular class. That is, the restrictions
      constrain the cardinality of that property on instances of
      that class. OWL Lite cardinality restrictions are limited
      because they only allow statements concerning cardinalities
      of value 0 or 1 (they do not allow arbitrary values for
      cardinality, as is the case in OWL DL and OWL Full).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><i><a id="minCardinality"
        name="minCardinality"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_minCardinality">
        minCardinality</a></i></b>: Cardinality is stated on a
        property with respect to a particular class. If a
        <i>minCardinality</i> of 1 is stated on a property with
        respect to a class, then any instance of that class will be
        related to at least one individual by that property. This
        restriction is another way of saying that the property is
        <u>required</u> to have a value for all instances of the
        class. For example, the class Person would not have any
        minimum cardinality restrictions stated on a hasOffspring
        property since not all persons have offspring. The class
        Parent, however would have a minimum cardinality of 1 on
        the hasOffspring property. If a reasoner knows that Louise
        is a Person, then nothing can be deduced about a minimum
        cardinality for her hasOffspring property. Once it is
        discovered that Louise is an instance of Parent, then a
        reasoner can deduce that Louise is related to at least one
        individual by the hasOffspring property. From this
        information alone, a reasoner can not deduce any maximum
        number of offspring for individual instances of the class
        parent. In OWL Lite the only minimum cardinalities allowed
        are 0 or 1. A minimum cardinality of zero on a property
        just states (in the absence of any more specific
        information) that the property is optional with respect to
        a class. For example, the property hasOffspring may have a
        minimum cardinality of zero on the class Person (while it
        is stated to have the more specific information of minimum
        cardinality of one on the class Parent).

        property with respect to a particular class. If a
        <i>maxCardinality</i> of 1 is stated on a property with
        respect to a class, then any instance of that class will be
        related to at most one individual by that property. A
        maxCardinality 1 restriction is sometimes called a
        functional or unique property. For example, the property
        hasRegisteredVotingState on the class UnitedStatesCitizens
        may have a maximum cardinality of one (because people are
        only allowed to vote in only one state). From this a
        reasoner can deduce that individual instances of the class
        USCitizens may not be related to two or more distinct
        individuals through the hasRegisteredVotingState property.
        From a maximum cardinality one restriction alone, a
        reasoner can not deduce a minimum cardinality of 1. It may
        be useful to state that certain classes have no values for
        a particular property. For example, instances of the class
        UnmarriedPerson should not be related to <u>any</u>
        individuals by the property hasSpouse. This situation is
        represented by a maximum cardinality of zero on the
        hasSpouse property on the class UnmarriedPerson.

        cardinality</a></i></b>: Cardinality is provided as a
        convenience when it is useful to state that a property on a

        <i>maxCardinality</i> 0 or both <i>minCardinality</i> 1 and
        <i>maxCardinality</i> 1. For example, the class Person has
        exactly one value for the property hasBirthMother. From
        this a reasoner can deduce that no two distinct individual
        instances of the class Mother may be values for the
        hasBirthMother property of the same person.

      <a id="s4" name="s4"></a>4. Incremental Language Description
      of OWL DL and OWL Full
    </h2>Both OWL DL and OWL Full use the same vocabulary although
    OWL DL is subject to some restrictions. Roughly, OWL DL
    requires type separation (a class can not also be an individual
    or property, a property can not also be an individual or
    class). This implies that restrictions cannot be applied to the
    language elements of OWL itself (something that is allowed in
    OWL Full). Furthermore, OWL DL requires that properties are
    either ObjectProperties or DatatypeProperties:
    DatatypeProperties are relations between instances of classes
    and RDF literals and XML Schema datatypes, while
    ObjectProperties are relations between instances of two
    classes. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/">OWL
    Semantics and Abstract Syntax</a> document explains the
    distinctions and limitations. We describe the OWL DL and OWL
    Full vocabulary that extends the constructions of OWL Lite
    below.

        oneOf</a></i></b>: (enumerated classes): Classes can be
        described by enumeration of the individuals that make up
        the class. The members of the class are exactly the set of
        enumerated individuals; no more, no less. For example, the
        class of daysOfTheWeek can be described by simply
        enumerating the individuals Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
        Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. From this a reasoner
        can deduce the maximum cardinality (7) of any property that
        has daysOfTheWeek as its allValuesFrom restriction.

        required to have a certain individual as a value (also

        instances of the class of dutchCitizens can be
        characterized as those people that have theNetherlands as a
        value of their nationality. (The nationality value,
        theNetherlands, is an instance of the class of

        disjoint from each other. For example, Man and Woman can be
        stated to be disjoint classes. From this disjointWith
        statement, a reasoner can deduce an inconsistency when an
        individual is stated to be an instance of both and
        similarly a reasoner can deduce that if A is an instance of
        Man, then A is <i>not</i> an instance of Woman.

        combinations): OWL DL and OWL Full allow arbitrary Boolean
        combinations of classes and restrictions: unionOf,
        complementOf, and intersectionOf. For example, using
        unionOf, we can state that a class contains things that are
        either USCitizens or DutchCitizens. Using complementOf, we
        could state that children are <i>not</i> SeniorCitizens.
        (i.e. the class Children is a subclass of the complement of
        SeniorCitizens). Citizenship of the European Union could be
        described as the union of the citizenship of all member

        While in OWL Lite, cardinalities are restricted to at
        least, at most or exactly 1 or 0, full OWL allows
        cardinality statements for arbitrary non-negative integers.
        For example the class of DINKs ("Dual Income, No Kids")
        would restrict the cardinality of the property hasIncome to
        a minimum cardinality of two (while the property hasChild
        would have to be restricted to cardinality 0).

        <b><i><a id="complexClassFull"

        many constructs, OWL Lite restricts the syntax to single
        class names (e.g. in subClassOf or equivalentClass
        statements). OWL Full extends this restriction to allow
        arbitrarily complex class descriptions, consisting of
        enumerated classes, property restrictions, and Boolean
        combinations. Also, OWL Full allows classes to be used as
        instances (and OWL DL and OWL Lite do not). For more on
