      <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
      <p> Annotation is a pervasive activity when reading or otherwise engaging
        with publications. In the physical world, highlighting and sticky notes
        are common paradigms for marking up and associating one's own content
        with the work being read, and many digital solutions exist in the same
        space. These digital solutions are, however, not interoperable between
        systems, even when there is only one user with multiple devices. </p>
      <p> This document lays out the use cases for annotations on digital
        publications, as envisioned by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
        Digital Publishing Interest Group, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
        Open Annotation Community Group and the International Digital Publishing
        Forum. The use cases are provided as a means to drive forwards the
        conversation about standards in this arena. </p>

        </span>Use Cases</h2>
      <p> The use cases are divided into five sections: annotations that target
        only the entire publication, annotations that target a particular part
        of a publication, more complex annotations, the publication of
        annotations and finally use cases that are directly related to
        accessibility. </p>

          <p> A user wishes to write a comment about a particular publication,
            such as a single issue of a comic or a single book title. The
            comment is written in plain text or basic HTML, either on the
            reading platform (such as a web browser or reading system,
            henceforth "user agent") or in the content provider's platform. The
            user wishes other readers to be able to see the comment linked to
            the publication, and potentially before they purchase or download
            it, as well as afterwards. </p>
          <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
          <p> </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Amy is reading Alice in Wonderland online and, using a tool
              built into the provider's website, comments that she really loves
              the way the book is written. She then shares this with her friend,
              Ben.</li>
            <li>Ben is reading a Manga comic on a mobile device. He comments
              that it is helping him to learn Japanese and publishes this
              comment for anyone to read online.</li>

              class="secno">2.1.2 </span>Tagging a Publication</h4>
          <p> A user wishes to organize their personal digital library by
            tagging the publications that they have access to. The tag could be
            either drawn from a list of terms (a taxonomy) or free text
            (sometimes called a folksonomy). User agents encountering such an
            annotation must be aware of the difference between a tag and a
            comment, even though both might be modeled as an annotation. Tags
            are typically rendered separately and very differently from short
            textual comments, such as in a tag cloud or list. The user then
            wishes to view their library partitioned via the tags. The user may
            wish to share their tags with other users to help the recipient
            categorize their own library, or find publications of mutual
            interest. </p>
          <h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Colleen has a collection of works of various types in her
              library about chemistry, science fiction and the renaissance. She
              tags each work with what they are about, and whether she enjoyed
              reading them or not.</li>
            <li>David tags an online poem about his home town with the URI for
              the location from Wikipedia. He publishes this annotation so that
              others can find it.</li>

              class="secno">2.1.3 </span>Structured Review of a Publication</h4>
          <p> A user wishes to provide a structured review of a particular
            publication, including pre-defined fields such as "star" ratings for
            quality, cost, entertainment or other domain-specific information.
            The review could also include a full text description, such as the
            comment in the first use case. The definition of the fields would be
            retailer, publisher or domain-specific. In the scholarly domain,
            this could be expected to provide a distributed and standardized
            peer-review system, rather than the current use of vendor-specific
            interfaces. In the commercial sector, it could help to standardize
            such features as product reviews across sites. </p>
          <h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Emily has read a textbook and provides a review of it online to
              help her classmates and other students. She gives it ratings on
              value for money, ease of use, ease of understanding, and overall
              quality, plus a long form description of the work.</li>
            <li>Fabio is reviewing a scholarly article for an academic
              publisher. The publisher requires various fields to be completed,
              such as relevance to the journal, novelty of the research, and
              quality of the experiments described. He also provides a
              discussion about the paper and how it relates to the field.</li>

            and annotation that links it to the publication. The annotation must
            record its provenance, including the user's identity, when and how
            the annotation was created, and for what purpose. This provenance is
            important for appropriate display of the annotation, filtering or
            ordering of annotations, maintaining and assigning credit for
            annotations, determining allowed usage of the annotation, and many
            other similar requirements. </p>
          <p> Desirable metadata features: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Ingrid annotates a short story that she has read for an online

              system keeps track of her identity for credit towards the class,
              when it was created to ensure that her work was submitted on time,
              the fact that it was created externally rather than within the
              coursework system, and other attributes.</li>
            <li>Jeremy discovers a typo in an online encyclopedia entry that is
              not able to be edited by users directly. He annotates the entry
              with the typo and gives the correction. The system records the
              provenance of the annotation and adds him into its reputation
              system, which generates an automatic scoreboard for users and

            have read up to in the publication, either with a manual or
            automatic bookmark. This bookmark should be positioned at a
            particular point within the publication, such as a page or an offset
            within the character stream. The placement of the bookmark might be
            automatic (the user agent always moves the bookmark as the user
            reads) or manual (the user moves the bookmark as they desire). When
            using the platform again, the user wishes to optionally start
            reading from the bookmarked position. </p>
          <p> The user also wishes to share this position with others to show
            how far through the publication they have progressed. This might be
            publically shared for bragging rights, shared semi-publically such
            as a reading group or class, or shared privately between platforms
            that the user has access to in order to maintain the position
            between devices. </p>

            or may not be important to maintain, this use case assumes that it
            is not. The emphasis might be to mark a passage of particular
            importance, a typo or other mistake, something to cite in another
            document, to bring to the attention of other readers, or to mark two
            such selections for comparison. The user may wish to share the
            highlight, and certainly wishes it to be accessible on multiple
            platforms to which she has access. In this use case there is no
            requirement to provide a comment or body of the annotation, simply
            to record a highlighted span of text. </p>

            type, but must be rendered by the reading system. Thus video, image,
            audio and similar are in scope for this use case, but not
            stylesheets or scripts which are not rendered directly. Annotations
            on audio files may present additional rendering challenges, compared

            silently at times for various reasons, then the annotations about
            the publication should be available on this new version rather than
            equally silently disappearing. As with any annotation that should be
            presented with more than just the resource it was created for, cross
            versioning allows for a wider audience and thus is a potential
            target for spammers. </p>

            associated with annotations are meaningful to an individual, to a

            annotations doesn't interfere with the reading of the publication.
            For example, annotations could be styled as a particular height and
            width, and then put into the margins of the page or over top of
            other white space. Annotations could be visually ordered such that
            reading them in the presented order gave a better experience than
            reading them in the order of the targets within the publication.
            Thirdly, the layout could be used for organization of thoughts
            concerning the publication by moving all of the related annotations
            together spatially. The location could be expressed as CSS absolute

            web may change their representation over time or may have multiple
            representations at the same time via content negotiation. The URI of
            the resource alone is thus not sufficient to determine the
            representation that was delivered to the annotator, and additional

          There are usability implications with annotating dynamically defined

          as an attack vector for spam or exploitation of user agent bugs by
          annoting common words on frequently visited URIs. For example,
          annotating "a" on the top million sites with an advertisement in the

            that the user gets credit in some system for reporting the

            case rather than within specific systems that understand the
            motivation of the annotation and when it has been resolved. </p>

              class="secno">2.4.1 </span>Sets of Annotations for a Publication</h4>
          <p> A publisher has one or more sets of annotations about a
            publication and wishes to supply those annotations along with the
            publication. Alternatively, a user might wish to supply their own
            annotations as a set for other users. These annotations could be
            comments by the author (in the same vein as DVD extras commentary),
            from famous readers, or simply pointers to related works. In an
            education setting, this functionality could be used to provide
            additional commentaries on a text book or other publication that are
            intended to assist the student in understanding the material. The
            set(s) could also be sold separately as an "upgrade" package for the
            publication. The order of the annotations may be important, for
            example to read the publication in chronological rather than
            narrative order, or by following the order of a class lectures
            rather than the order of the chapters in the text book. The metadata
            about the collection of annotations is also important, such as who
            packaged them together and for what purpose. </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Wesley works for a publishing house and has transformed the

              annotations for sale. The company wishes to have them available as
              an add-on for customers that have already bought the novel, and
              also in a bundle for new sales. </li>
            <li>Xena is a PhD student studying a famous detective story set in
              London. She works out a walking route that takes the user through
              all of the locations in the book in an optimal fashion, which is
              not the same order as the narrative, and wants to publish her
              annotations about the locations in that sequence. </li>

              class="secno">2.4.2 </span>Persistence of Annotations</h4>
          <p> A user wishes to save the annotation that they have created in
            order to retrieve it later, regardless of whether it is finished or
            not. The Annotation should be given a unique and resolvable
            identifier. The user may wish to save the annotation in their own
            system, rather than the system which provides the resource being
            annotated. The user may equally wish to save the annotation in
            multiple systems. The annotation should persist in local storage if
            the user is offline, and be persisted globally once the connection
            is re-established. In the interim, a locally unique identifier
            should be assigned to the annotation. Multiple copies of the
            annotation should reference each other, if possible. </p>
          <h4 id="examples-25">Examples</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Yasir writes an annotation about an astronomy publication and
              wants to save it both in his own system and remotely for others.</li>
            <li>Zoe writes an annotation about Greek mythology which becomes
              popular and is syndicated widely across many systems after its
              initial publication online. The syndicated copies refer back to
              the original source, which Xena uses for credit towards promotion.

            between Systems</h4>
          <p> Either the user or the system requests that all or some subset of
            annotations that are maintained be transferred to another system. If
            the user requests it, then it this enables an export functionality
            such that the user's annotations can be exported to another platform
            or device. If the system requests it, then this enables a
            synchronization functionality where the user's annotations will be
            maintained in multiple locations for ease of use and preservation,
            or aggregation for analysis. Both such cases should use the same
            mechanism. </p>

            academic research group or only with a set of friends in a social

            platform. </p>
          <p> The user may also wish to keep only some aspect of the annotation
            private, for example the comment should be protected, while the
