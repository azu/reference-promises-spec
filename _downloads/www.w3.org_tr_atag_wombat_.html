<h2 class="nonb"><a name="abstract" id="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

<p>This specification provides guidelines for Web authoring tool developers.
Its purpose is two-fold: to assist developers in designing authoring tools
that produce accessible Web content and to assist developers in creating an
accessible authoring interface.</p>

<p>Authoring tools can enable, encourage, and assist users ("authors") in the
creation of accessible Web content through prompts, alerts, checking and
repair functions, help files and automated tools. It is just as important
that all people be able to author content as it is for all people to have
access to it. The tools used to create this information must therefore be
accessible themselves. Adoption of these guidelines will contribute to the
proliferation of Web content that can be read by a broader range of readers
and authoring tools that can be used by a broader range of authors.</p>

<p>This document is part of a series of accessibility documents published by
the <abbr title="the World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <a
href="/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a> (<abbr>WAI</abbr>).</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 class="nonb"><a name="status" id="status">Status of this document</a></h2>

<p><em>This section describes the status of this document at the time of its
publication. Other documents may supersede this document. The latest status
of this document series is maintained at the <abbr
title="the World Wide Web  Consortium">W3C</abbr>.</em></p>

<p>This document has been produced by the <a href="/WAI/AU/">Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (<abbr
title="Authoring  Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group">AUWG</abbr>)</a>,
part of the <a href="/WAI">Web Accessibility Initiative (<abbr
title="Web  Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr>)</a>. The goals of the
Working Group are discussed in the <a href="/WAI/AU/charter.html"><abbr
title="Authoring  Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group">AUWG</abbr>
charter</a>.</p>

<p>This document has been made available to the WAI Interest Group for
review, but is not endorsed by them. This is a working draft, and it is not
endorsed by the W3C or its members. It is inappropriate to refer to this
document other than as "work in progress".</p>

<p>This is the first Public Working Draft of a document which <em>may</em>
eventually supersede the W3C Recommendation <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
1.0</a> [<a href="#ref-ATAG10">ATAG10</a>]. The Working Group has made it
available for review by W3C Members and other interested parties, in
accordance with W3C Process.</p>

<p>This draft refers to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(<acronym>WCAG</acronym>) 1.0 for specification of accessible content. It is
expected (but not guaranteed) that if <span
title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines</span> 2.0 [<a href="#ref-WCAG20">WCAG20</a>] (currently in
Working Draft status) becomes a W3C Recommendation, the Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines "Wombat" document will refer to WCAG 2.0 and become
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0.</p>

<p>The Working Group expects the current "Wombat" draft to be
backwards-compatible with <acronym
title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</acronym> 1.0, or at
most to make only minor changes in requirements. Before this document reaches
last call, the Working Group will publish a detailed analysis of the
differences in requirements. This version is expected to be easier to use. It
results from experience with <acronym
title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</acronym> 1.0, and
working group review of previous versions of this draft, and is intended to
fulfill the <a href="/WAI/AU/wombat/reqs.html">requirements for a new
version</a> set by the Working Group.</p>

<p>As an initial internal draft, this document still refers (non-normatively)
to the Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility1.0 [<a
href="#ref-ATAG10-TECHS">ATAG10-TECHS</a>]. As part of development of this
draft, it is expected that the working group will draft a matching version of
the Techniques information.</p>

<p>Please send general comments about this document to the public mailing
list: <a href="mailto:w3c-wai-au@w3.org">w3c-wai-au@w3.org</a> (<a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au">public archives</a>).
Outstanding issues identified by the Working group are marked within this
document, and the Working Group particularly welcomes comment on those.

<h2>1. <a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>In these guidelines, the term "<a href="#def-authoring-tool"
rel="glossary" title="Definition of Authoring Tool"><span
class="dfn-instance">authoring tool</span></a>" refers to the wide range of
software used for creating Web content, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Editing tools specifically designed to produce Web content (e.g.,
    WYSIWYG HTML and XML editors);</li>
  <li>Tools that offer the option of saving material in a Web format (e.g.,
    word processors or desktop publishing packages);</li>
  <li>Tools that transform documents into Web formats (e.g., filters to
    transform desktop publishing formats to HTML);</li>
  <li>Tools that produce multimedia, especially where it is intended for use
    on the Web (e.g., video production and editing suites, SMIL authoring
    packages);</li>
  <li>Tools for site management or site publication, including tools that
    automatically generate Web sites dynamically from a database, on-the-fly
    conversion tools, and Web site publishing tools;</li>
  <li>Tools for management of layout (e.g., CSS formatting tools).</li>
</ul>

<p>The goals of this document can be stated as follows: that the authoring
tool be accessible to authors regardless of disability, that it produce
accessible content by default, and that it support and encourage the author
in creating accessible content. Because most of the content of the Web is
created using authoring tools, they play a critical role in ensuring the <a
href="#def-Accessibility" rel="glossary"
title="Definition of Accessibility"><span
class="dfn-instance">accessibility</span></a> of the Web. Since the Web is
both a means of receiving information and communicating information, it is
important that both the Web content produced and the authoring tool itself be
accessible.</p>

<p>To achieve these goals, authoring tool developers must take steps such as
ensuring conformance to accessible standards (e.g., HTML 4), checking and
correcting accessibility problems, prompting, and providing appropriate
documentation and help. For detailed information about what constitutes
accessible content, these guidelines rely on the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0 <a href="#ref-WCAG10"
title="Link to reference WCAG10">[WCAG10]</a>. Similarly, rather than
directly reproducing existing specifications that address general accessible
software design, these guidelines rely on other sources. The present
guidelines do address accessible design considerations specific to Web
authoring tools such as providing flexible editing views, navigation aids and
access to display properties for authors.</p>

<p>The principles set forth in these guidelines will benefit many people who
do not have a disability but who have similar needs. This includes people who
work in noisy or quiet environments where the use of sound is not practical,
people who need to use their eyes for another task and are unable to view a
screen, and people who use small mobile devices that have a small screen, no
keyboard, and no mouse.</p>

<p>A separate document, entitled "Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0" <a href="#ref-ATAG10-TECHS"
title="Link to reference ATAG10-TECHS">[ATAG10-TECHS]</a>, provides
suggestions and examples of how each checkpoint might be satisfied. It also
includes references to other accessibility resources (such as
platform-specific software accessibility guidelines) that provide additional
information on how a tool may satisfy each checkpoint. Readers are strongly
encouraged to become familiar with the Techniques Document as well as
"Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" <a
href="#ref-WCAG10-TECHS"
title="Link to  reference WCAG10-TECHS">[WCAG10-TECHS]</a> and "Techniques
for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" <a href="#ref-UAAG10-TECHS"
title="Link to  reference UAAG10-TECHS">[UAAG10-TECHS]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The techniques in <a href="#ref-ATAG10-TECHS"
title="Link to reference ATAG10-TECHS">[ATAG10-TECHS]</a> are informative
examples only. Other strategies may be used to satisfy the checkpoints in
addition to, or in place of, those discussed in <a href="#ref-ATAG10-TECHS"
title="Link to  reference ATAG10-TECHS">[ATAG10-TECHS]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Authoring tools that conform to this document will
propagate accessible Web content and be useful to anyone regardless of
disability. There will also be authoring tools that produce accessible
content in favorable circumstances (e.g., a text editor used by a motivated
author), or provide an accessible interface to authors with certain
disabilities, but that do not conform to these guidelines.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>1.1 <a name="organized" id="organized">How the Guidelines are
organized</a></h3>

<p>The seven guidelines in this document are general principles for
accessible design. Each guideline includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The guideline number;</li>
  <li>The statement of the guideline;</li>
  <li>The rationale behind the guideline;</li>
  <li>A list of checkpoint definitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The checkpoint definitions in each guideline specify requirements for
authoring tools to follow the guideline. Each checkpoint definition
includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The checkpoint number;</li>
  <li>The statement of the checkpoint;</li>
  <li>The priority of the checkpoint;</li>
  <li>Checkpoint subtext. This (almost) always includes 
    <ul>
      <li>a minimum basic functionality requirement that is normative</li>
      <li>a brief rationale for the checkpoint</li>
      <li>suggested functionality for more advanced implementation (this is
        optional)</li>
      <li>references to further information - at least a link to a section of
        "Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" <a
        href="#ref-ATAG10-TECHS"
        title="Link to reference ATAG10-TECHS">[ATAG10-TECHS]</a> where
        implementations and examples of the checkpoint are discussed</li>
      <li><span class="issue"><a name="issue2" id="issue2"
        href="/WAI/AU/wombatissues.html#issue2">[@@issue 2</a>: the titles of
        these sections is not consistent in the current draft. Is there one
        form that is clearer than others?]</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each checkpoint is intended to be specific enough that it can be verified,
while being sufficiently general to allow developers the freedom to use the
most appropriate strategies to satisfy it.</p>

<p>An appendix to this specification <a href="#ref-WOMBAT-CHECKLIST"
title="Link to reference WOMBAT-CHECKLIST">[WOMBAT-CHECKLIST]</a> lists all
checkpoints, ordered by priority, for convenient reference.</p>
</div>

<div class="priorities-specific">
<h3>1.2 <a name="priorities" id="priorities">Checkpoint Priorities</a></h3>

<p>Each checkpoint has a priority level. The priority level reflects the
impact of the checkpoint in meeting the goals of this specification. These
goals are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>That the authoring tool be accessible;</li>
  <li>That the authoring tool produce accessible content by default;</li>
  <li>That the authoring tool encourage the creation of accessible
  content.</li>
</ul>

<p>The priority levels are assigned as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="priority-1" id="priority-1">[Priority 1]</a></dt>
    <dd>If the checkpoint is essential to meeting the goals.</dd>
  <dt><a name="priority-2" id="priority-2">[Priority 2]</a></dt>
    <dd>If the checkpoint is important to meeting the goals.</dd>
  <dt>[<a name="priority-3" id="priority-3">Priority 3]</a></dt>
    <dd>If the checkpoint is beneficial to meeting the goals.</dd>
  <dt><a name="priority-rel" id="priority-rel">[Relative Priority]</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Some checkpoints that refer to generating, authoring, or checking
      Web content have multiple priorities. The priority depends on the
      corresponding priority in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
      (<abbr title="Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>) 1.0
      <a href="#ref-WCAG10"
      title="Link to  reference WCAG10">[WCAG10]</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is priority 1 to satisfy the checkpoint for content features
          that are a priority 1 requirement in <abbr
          title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 1.0.</li>
        <li>It is priority 2 to satisfy the checkpoint for content features
          that are a priority 2 requirement in <abbr
          title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 1.0.</li>
        <li>It is priority 3 to satisfy the checkpoint for content features
          that are a priority 3 requirement in <abbr
          title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 1.0.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing <a href="#def-alt-eq" rel="glossary"
          title="Definition of  Alternative Information"><span
          class="dfn-instance">text equivalents</span></a> for images and
          audio is a priority 1 requirement in <abbr
          title="Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 1.0 since
          without it one or more groups will find it impossible to access the
          information. Therefore, it is a priority 1 requirement for the
          authoring tool to check for (<a href="#check-notify-on-schedule"
          class="noxref">4.1</a>) or ask the author for (<a
          href="#check-provide-missing-alt" class="noxref">3.1</a>)
          equivalent alternatives for these types of content.</li>
        <li>Grouping links in navigation bars is a priority 3 in <abbr
          title="Web  Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG 1.0</abbr>.
          Therefore, it is only priority 3 for the authoring tool to check
          for (<a href="#check-notify-on-schedule" class="noxref">4.1</a>) or
          ask the author for (<a href="#check-help-provide-structure"
          class="noxref">3.2</a>) groups of links that are not grouped in the
          markup as a navigation mechanism.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    <dd><p>When a checkpoint in this document refers to the <abbr
      title="Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 1.0 <a
      href="#ref-WCAG10" title="Link to  reference WCAG10">[WCAG10]</a>, only
      the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility  Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 1.0
      checkpoints that refer to content supported or automatically generated
      by the authoring tool apply. Some of the applicable <abbr
      title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 1.0
      checkpoints may be satisfied automatically (without author
      participation) while others require human judgment and support from the
      tool in the form of prompts and documentation. Different tools may
      satisfy the same checkpoint differently.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>The priority level for each checkpoint has been chosen based on the
assumption that the author is a competent, but not necessarily expert, user
of the authoring tool, and that the author has little or no knowledge of
accessibility. For example, the author is not expected to have read all of
the documentation, but is expected to know how to turn to the documentation
for assistance.</p>

<div>
<h3>1.3 <a name="conformance" id="conformance">Conformance to these
Guidelines</a></h3>

<p>This section explains how to make a <a href="#claim-validation">valid
claim</a> that an authoring tool conforms to this document. Anyone may make a
claim (e.g., vendors about their own products, third parties about those
products, journalists about products, etc.). Claims may be published anywhere
(e.g., on the Web or in product documentation).</p>

<p>The <a href="#conformance-icons">conformance icons</a> provided for
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 are not valid for expressing
conformance to this draft</p>

<h4 id="Conformanc"><a name="conformance-levels"

  <li><strong>Conformance Level "Triple-A"</strong> : all Priority 1, 2, and
    3 checkpoints (including Relative Priority checkpoints) are
  satisfied.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Conformance levels are spelled out in text (e.g.,
"Double-A" rather than "AA") so they may be understood when rendered as
speech.</p>

<div>
<p>If the tool automatically generates markup, many authors will be unaware
of the accessibility status of the final content unless they expend extra
effort to review it and make appropriate corrections by hand. Since many
authors are unfamiliar with accessibility, authoring tools are responsible
for automatically generating accessible markup, and where appropriate, for
guiding the author in producing accessible content.</p>

<p>Many applications feature the ability to convert <a href="#def-document"
rel="glossary" title="Definition of Document"><span
class="dfn-instance">documents</span></a> from other formats (e.g., Rich Text
Format) into a markup format specifically intended for the Web such as HTML.
Markup changes may also be made to facilitate efficient editing and
manipulation. It is essential that these processes do not introduce <a
href="#def-inaccessible-markup" rel="glossary"
title="Definition of Inaccessible Markup"><span
class="dfn-instance">inaccessible markup</span></a> or remove accessibility
content, particularly when a tool hides the markup changes from the author's
view.</p>

<div>
<p>Well-structured information and <a href="#def-alt-eq" rel="glossary"
title="Definition of Alternative Information"><span
class="dfn-instance">equivalent alternative information</span></a> are
cornerstones of accessible design, allowing information to be presented in a
way most appropriate for the needs of the user without constraining the
creativity of the author. Yet producing equivalent information, such as text
alternatives for images and auditory descriptions of video, can be one of the
most challenging aspects of Web design, and authoring tool developers should
attempt to facilitate and automate the mechanics of this process. For
example, prompting authors to include equivalent alternative information such
as <a href="#def-alt-eq" rel="glossary"
title="Definition of Alternative Information"><span class="dfn-instance">text
equivalents</span></a>, <a href="#def-video-captions" rel="glossary"

rel="glossary" title="Definition of Auditory Description"><span
class="dfn-instance">auditory descriptions</span></a> at appropriate times
can greatly ease the burden for authors. Where such information can be
mechanically determined and offered as a choice for the author (e.g., the
function of icons in an automatically-generated navigation bar, or expansion
of acronyms from a dictionary), the tool can assist the author. At the same
time, the tool can reinforce the need for such information and the author's
role in ensuring that it is used appropriately in each instance.</p>

<h3 class="guideline">Guideline 4. <a name="gl-identify-markup"
id="gl-identify-markup">Provide ways of checking and correcting inaccessible
content.</a></h3>

<p>Many authoring tools allow authors to create documents with little or no
knowledge about the underlying markup. To ensure accessibility, authoring
tools must be designed so that they can (where possible, automatically)
identify <a href="#def-inaccessible-markup" rel="glossary"
title="Definition of  Inaccessible Markup"><span
class="dfn-instance">inaccessible markup</span></a>, and enable its
correction even when the markup itself is hidden from the author.</p>

<p>Authoring tool support for the creation of accessible Web content should
account for different authoring styles. Authors who can configure the tool's
accessibility features to support their regular work patterns are more likely
to accept accessible authoring practices (refer to <a
href="#gl-integrate-naturally">guideline 5</a>). For example, some authors
may prefer to be alerted to <a href="#def-accessibility-problem"
rel="glossary" title="Definition of Accessibility Problem"><span
class="dfn-instance">accessibility problems</span></a> when they occur,
whereas others may prefer to perform a check at the end of an editing
session. This is analogous to programming environments that allow users to
decide whether to check for correct code during editing or at compilation.</p>

checking the accessibility of content.</p>

<h3 class="guideline">Guideline 7. <a name="gl-make-accessible"
id="gl-make-accessible">Ensure that the authoring tool is accessible to
authors with disabilities.</a></h3>

<div>
<p>The authoring tool is a software program with standard user interface
elements and as such must be designed according to relevant user interface
accessibility guidelines. When custom interface components are created, it is
essential that they be accessible through the standard access mechanisms for
the relevant platform so that assistive technologies can be used with
them.</p>

<p>Some additional user interface design considerations apply specifically to
<a href="#def-authoring-tool" rel="glossary"
title="Definition of Authoring Tool"><span class="dfn-instance">Web authoring
tools.</span></a> For instance, authoring tools must ensure that the author
can edit (in an <a href="#def-Editing" rel="glossary"
title="Definition of Editing View"><span class="dfn-instance">editing
view</span></a>) using one set of stylistic preferences and publish using
different styles. Authors with low vision may need large text when editing
but want to publish with a smaller default text size. The style preferences
of the editing view must not affect the markup of the published document.</p>

<p>Authoring tools must also ensure that the author can navigate a document
efficiently while editing, regardless of disability. Authors who use screen
readers, refreshable braille displays, or screen magnifiers can make limited
use (if at all) of graphical artifacts that communicate the structure of the
document and act as signposts when traversing it. Authors who cannot use a
mouse (e.g., people with physical disabilities or who are blind) must use the
slow and tiring process of moving one step at a time through the document to
access the desired content, unless more efficient navigation methods are
available. Authoring tools should therefore provide an <a href="#def-Editing"
rel="glossary" title="Definition of Editing View"><span
class="dfn-instance">editing view</span></a> that conveys a sense of the
overall structure and allows structured navigation.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Documentation, help files, and installation are
part of the software and need to be available in an <a href="#def-Accessible"
rel="glossary" title="Definition of Accessible"><span

        <li>In some instances, an authoring tool will be able to check for

          validity (<a href="#check-ensure-published-DTD"
          class="noxref">checkpoint 2.2</a>) or testing whether an image is
          the only content of a link.</li>
        <li>In some cases, the tool will be able to "suspect" or "guess" that
          there is a problem, but will need confirmation from the author. For
          example, in making sure that a sensible reading order is preserved
          a tool can present a linearized version of a page to the
        author.</li>
        <li>In some cases, a tool must rely mostly on the author, and can
          only ask the author to check. For example, the tool may prompt the
          author to verify that equivalent alternatives for multimedia are
          appropriate. This is the minimal standard to be satisfied. Subtle,
          rather than extensive, prompting is more likely to be effective in
          encouraging the author to verify accessibility where it cannot be
          done automatically.</li>

  <dt><a name="def-document" id="def-document"><dfn>Document</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>A "document" is a series of elements that are defined by a <a
      href="#def-Markup-Language" rel="glossary"
      title="Definition of Markup Language"><span class="dfn-instance">markup
      language</span></a> (e.g., HTML 4 or an XML application).</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-Editing" id="def-Editing"><dfn>Editing View</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>An "editing view" is a <a href="#def-view" rel="glossary"
      title="Definition  of View"><span class="dfn-instance">view</span></a>
      provided by the authoring tool that allows editing.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-element" id="def-element"><dfn>Element</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>An "element" is any identifiable object within a document, for
      example, a character, word, image, paragraph or spreadsheet cell. In <a
      href="#ref-HTML4" title="Link to reference HTML4">[HTML4]</a> and <a
      href="#ref-XML" title="Link  to reference XML">[XML]</a>, an element
      refers to a pair of tags and their content, or an "empty" tag - one
      that requires no closing tag or content.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-inform" id="def-inform"><dfn>Inform</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>To "inform" is to make the author aware of an event or situation
      through <a href="#def-alert" rel="glossary"
      title="Definition of Alert"><span
      class="dfn-instance">alert</span></a>, <a href="#def-prompt"
      rel="glossary" title="Definition of Prompt"><span
      class="dfn-instance">prompt</span></a>, sound, flash, or other
    means.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-Markup-Language" id="def-Markup-Language"><dfn>Markup
  Language</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>Authors encode information using a "markup language" such as HTML <a
      href="#ref-HTML4" title="Link to reference HTML4">[HTML4]</a>, SVG <a
      href="#ref-SVG" title="Link to reference SVG">[SVG]</a>, or MathML <a
      href="#ref-MATHML" title="Link to reference MATHML">[MATHML]</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-presentation-markup"
  id="def-presentation-markup"><dfn>Presentation Markup</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>"Presentation markup" is <a href="#def-Markup-Language"
      rel="glossary" title="Definition of Markup Language"><span
      class="dfn-instance">markup language</span></a> that encodes
      information about the desired presentation or layout of the content.
      For example, Cascading Style Sheets (<a href="#ref-CSS1"
      title="Link to reference CSS1">[CSS1]</a>, <a href="#ref-CSS2"
      title="Link to  reference CSS2">[CSS2]</a>) can be used to control
      fonts, colors, aural rendering, and graphical positioning. Presentation
      markup should not be used in place of <a href="#def-structural-markup"
      rel="glossary" title="Definition of  Structural Markup"><span
      class="dfn-instance">structural markup</span></a> to convey structure.
      For example, authors should mark up lists in HTML with proper list
      markup and style them with CSS (e.g., to control spacing, bullets,
      numbering, etc.). Authors should not use other CSS or HTML incorrectly
      to lay out content graphically so that it resembles a list.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-prompt" id="def-prompt"><dfn>Prompt</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>In this document prompt does not refer to the narrow software sense
      of a "prompt," rather it is used as a verb meaning to urge, suggest and
      encourage. The form and timing that this prompting takes can be user
      configurable. "Prompting" does not depend upon the author to seek out
      the support but is initiated by the tool. "Prompting" is more than
      checking, correcting, and providing help and documentation as
      encompassed in guidelines 4, 5, 6. The goal of prompting the author is
      to encourage, urge and support the author in creating meaningful
      equivalent text without causing frustration that may cause the author
      to turn off access options. Prompting should be implemented in such a
      way that it causes a positive disposition and awareness on the part of
      the author toward accessible authoring practices.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-Property" id="def-Property"><dfn>Property</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>A "property" is a piece of information about an element, for example
      structural information (e.g., it is item number 7 in a list, or plain
      text) or presentation information (e.g., that it is marked as bold, its
      font size is 14). In XML and HTML, properties of an element include the
      type of the element (e.g., <code>IMG</code> or <code>DL</code>), the
      values of its <a href="#def-attribute" rel="glossary"
      title="Definition of Attribute"><span
      class="dfn-instance">attributes</span></a>, and information associated
      by means of a style sheet. In a database, properties of a particular
      element may include values of the entry, and acceptable data types for
      that entry.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-structural-markup"
  id="def-structural-markup"><dfn>Structural Markup</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>"Structural markup" is <a href="#def-Markup-Language" rel="glossary"
      title="Definition of Markup Language"><span class="dfn-instance">markup
      language</span></a> that encodes information about the structural role
      of elements of the content. For example, headings, sections, members of
      a list, and components of a complex diagram can be identified using
      structural markup. Structural markup should not be used incorrectly to
      control presentation or layout. For example, authors should not use the
      <code>BLOCKQUOTE</code> element in HTML <a href="#ref-HTML4"
      title="Link to reference HTML4">[HTML4]</a> to achieve an indentation
      visual layout effect. Structural markup should be used correctly to
      communicate the roles of the elements of the content and <a
      href="#def-presentation-markup" rel="glossary"
      title="Definition of Presentation  Markup"><span
      class="dfn-instance">presentation markup</span></a> should be used
      separately to control the presentation and layout.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-transcript"
  id="def-transcript"><dfn>Transcript</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>A "transcript" is a text representation of sounds in an audio clip or
      an auditory track of a multimedia presentation. A "collated text
      transcript" for a video combines (collates) caption text with text
      descriptions of video information (descriptions of the actions, body
      language, graphics, and scene changes of the visual track). Collated
      text transcripts are essential for individuals who are deaf-blind and
      rely on braille for access to movies and other content.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-Transformation"
  id="def-Transformation"><dfn>Transformation</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>A "transformation" is a process that changes a document or object
      into another, equivalent, object according to a discrete set of rules.
      This includes <a href="#def-conversion-tool" rel="glossary"
      title="Definition of Conversion  Tool"><span
      class="dfn-instance">conversion tools</span></a>, software that allows
      the author to change the <abbr
      title="Document Type Definition">DTD</abbr> defined for the original
      document to another <abbr title="Document  Type Definition">DTD</abbr>,
      and the ability to change the markup of lists and convert them into
      tables.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-User-Agent" id="def-User-Agent"><dfn>User
  Agent</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>A "user agent" is software that retrieves and renders Web content.
      User agents include browsers, plug-ins for a particular media type, and
      some assistive technologies.</dd>
  <dt><a name="def-view" id="def-view"><dfn>View</dfn></a></dt>
    <dd>Authoring tools may render the same content in a variety of ways;
      each rendering is called a "view." Some authoring tools will have
      several different types of view, and some allow views of several
      documents at once. For instance, one view may show raw markup, a second
      may show a structured tree, a third may show markup with rendered
      objects while a final view shows an example of how the document may
      appear if it were to be rendered by a particular browser. A typical way
      to distinguish views in a graphic environment is to place each in a
      separate window.</dd>
