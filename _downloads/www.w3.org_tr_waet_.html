  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
  <p>This document describes features that web authoring and quality assurance tools can incorporate, so that they support the evaluation of accessibility requirements, such as those defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) 2.0</a>. The main purpose of this document is to promote awareness of such tool features and to provide introductory guidance for tool developers on what kind of features they could provide in future implementations of their tools. This listing of features could also be used to help compare different types of evaluation tools, for example during the procurement of such tools.</p>
  <p>The features in scope of this document include capabilities to help specify, manage, carry out and report the results from web accessibility evaluations. For example, some of the described features relate to crawling of websites, interacting with tool users to carry out semi-automated evaluation, and providing evaluation results in a machine-readable format. This document does not describe the evaluation of web content features, which is addressed by <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.0 and its supporting documents.</p>
  <p>This document encourages the incorporation of accessibility evaluation features in all web authoring and quality assurance tools, and the continued development and creation of different types of web accessibility evaluation tools. The document does not prioritize nor require any particular accessibility evaluation feature or specific type of evaluation tools. It describes features that can be provided by tools that support fully-automated, semi-automated, and manual web accessibility evaluation. Following this document can help tool developers to meet accessibility checking requirements defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>ATAG</abbr>)</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="intro">1 Introduction</h2> 
    <p>Designing, developing, monitoring, and managing a website typically involves a variety of tasks and people who use different types of tools. For example, a web developer might use an integrated development environment (<abbr>IDE</abbr>) to create templates for a content management system (<abbr>CMS</abbr>), while a web content author will typically use the content-editing facility provided by the <abbr>CMS</abbr> to create and edit the web pages. Ideally all these tools provide features to support everyone involved throughout the process in evaluating accessibility. For example, an <abbr>IDE</abbr> could provide functionality to check document fragments so that the developer can check individual web page components during their development, and a <abbr>CMS</abbr> could provide functionality to customize the accessibility checks that are automatically carried out to help monitor the quality of the website. This document lists and describes these types of features that can be provided by tools to support accessibility evaluation in a variety of situations and contexts.</p>

    <h3 id="tools">1.1 Evaluation Tools</h3>
<p>In the context of this document, an <strong id="evaltool_def">evaluation tool</strong> is a (web-based or non-web-based) software application that enables its users to evaluate web content according to specific quality criteria, such as web accessibility requirements. This includes but is not limited to the following (non-mutually-exclusive) types of tools:</p> <ul>
      <li id="authoringtool_def"><strong>Web authoring tool</strong> - <cite>Any web-based or non-web-based application(s) that can be used by authors (alone or collaboratively) to create or modify web content for use by other people (other authors or end users)</cite>; from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>ATAG</abbr>) 2.0</a>;</li>
<li id="qatool_def"><strong>Web quality assurance tool</strong> - Any (web-based or non-web-based) software application that is specifically designed to evaluate web content according to quality criteria (that are usually broader than accessibility requirements alone);</li>
<li id="a11ytool_def"><strong>Web accessibility evaluation tool</strong> - Any (web-based or non-web-based) software application that is specifically designed to evaluate web content according to accessibility requirements, such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility
      Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) 2.0</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that these terms are not mutually exclusive. A web accessibility evaluation tool is a particular type of web quality assurance tool. In some cases it can be part of a web authoring tool, or considered to be a web authoring tool depending on the functionality that it provides (see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool"><abbr>ATAG</abbr> 2.0 definition for <em>authoring tool</em></a>). Also, a web quality assurance tool might not check for accessibility criteria but might provide other functionality, such as for managing quality assurance processes and reporting evaluation results, that may be useful for web accessibility evaluation. This document refers to any of these tools collectively as evaluation tools.</p>
    <p><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web Accessibility Initiative (<abbr>WAI</abbr>) provides a <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/">list of web accessibility evaluation tools</a> that can be searched according to different criteria such as the features listed in this document. <span class="highlight">[<strong>Editor Note:</strong> The list of web accessibility evaluation is currently out of date. It is expected to be updated before the next publication of this document.]</span></p>

  <h2 id="features">2 Features of an accessibility evaluation tool</h2><p
  class="note">[<strong>Review Note:</strong> Feedback on this section is
  particularly welcome, specifically with suggestions for accessibility
  evaluation features that are not listed below and with comments to refine
  listed accessibility evaluation features.] </p><p>The features of an
  accessibility evaluation tool are presented in this section from different
  perspectives: the <strong>resource to be evaluated</strong> (i.e., web
  content and its linked resources, which enable its rendering to the user
  agent and end user), <strong>the testing requirements</strong>, the
  <strong>reporting customization capabilities of the tool</strong> and other
  <strong>tool usage</strong> characteristics like the integration into the
  development and editing workflow of the user.</p><p>The accessibility
  evaluation features listed and described below is not exhaustive. It may
  not be possible nor desired for a single tool to implement all of the listed
  features either. For example, tools that are specifically designed to assist
  designers in creating web page layouts would likely not incorporate features
  for evaluating the code of web applications. Developers can use this list to
  identify features that are relevant to their tools to plan their
  implementation. Also others interested in acquiring and using evaluation
  tools can use this document to learn about relevant features to look
  for.</p><h3 id="subjects">2.1 Retrieving and rendering web content</h3>
  <p>This category includes features that help to retrieve and render
  different types of web content. There are tools that may retrieve the
  content to be analyzed from the file system or from a database. However, the
  majority of them do it via a network connection through the
  <abbr>HTTP(S)</abbr> protocol. This section focuses mostly on this latter scenario. </p><p>Due to the characteristics of the
  <abbr>HTTP(S)</abbr> protocol, the rendering of a web resource implies the
  manipulation and storage of many other components associated with it, like
  request and response headers, session information, cookies, authentication
  information, etc. These associated components are also considered in the
  following. </p> <h4 id="typedoc">2.1.1 Content types</h4> <p> Although the
  majority of web resources are <abbr>HTML</abbr> documents, there are many
  other types of resources that need to be considered when analyzing web
  accessibility. For example, resources like <abbr>CSS</abbr> stylesheets or
  JavaScript scripts allow the modification of markup documents in the user
  agent when they are loaded or via user interaction. Many accessibility tests
  are the result of the interpretation of those resources and are therefore
  important for an accessibility evaluation. Accessibility evaluation tools
  should state which types of formats they support.</p> <p>Some types of content formats include:</p> <ul>
      <li><strong>Markup documents</strong>. These are normally
      <abbr>HTML</abbr> [<a href="#HTML4">HTML4</a>, <a
      href="#HTML5">HTML5</a>] or <abbr>XML</abbr> documents. Processing these
      resources typically requires the ability to build a Document Object
      Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>) [<a href="#DOM">DOM</a>] according to the
      different specifications, which can then be parsed and analyzed.</li>

      <li><strong>Style resources</strong>. These are presentation modifiers,
      which conform to the different <abbr>CSS</abbr> specifications
      [<a href="#CSS2">CSS2</a>, <a href="#CSS3">CSS3</a>]. The interpretation
      of stylesheets is relevant for many accessibility techniques.</li>

      <li><strong>Script resources</strong>. These are components that modify
      the content or the presentation of web resources and web applications,
      be it because of user interaction or because of other functional
      requirements (e.g., notifications, dynamic updates, etc.). These
      resources play a critical role in Rich Internet Applications. Ignoring
      these resources may lead to missing accessibility problems or to report
      non-existing errors. The scripting language commonly used on the web is
      JavaScript, based upon ECMAScript [<a href="#ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a>]
      standardized by the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">Ecma
      International</a> standards organization.</li>

      <li><strong>Media resources</strong>. These are images (static or
      animated), movies or audio tracks, which are standalone or embedded in a
      web resource. From the accessibility standpoint, the evaluation of these
      resources is relevant for issues like colour contrast, colour blindness
      or media alternatives, for instance.</li>

      <li><strong>Other document formats</strong>. Many reports and
      administrative information are available in other document formats,
      typically in government websites. The format most commonly found is
      <abbr>PDF</abbr>, initially developed by Adobe [<a href="#PDF">PDF</a>]
      and later on standardised by <abbr>ISO</abbr>. Although not very
      frequent on the web, it is possible to encounter as well other formats
      like Apache OpenOffice [<a href="#ODF">ODF</a>] or Microsoft Office [<a
      href="#OOXML">OOXML</a>].</li>

      <li><strong>Resources with other formats</strong>. Examples of these
      could be <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html">Adobe
      Flash</a>, <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java applets</a>, <a
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/">Microsoft Silverlight</a>,
      etc. These resources are normally found embedded within
      <abbr>HTML</abbr> pages as applications.</li>
    </ul><h4 id="encoding">2.1.2 Content encoding and content language</h4>
  <p>This feature identifies which content languages and encodings are
  supported by the evaluation tool. The web is a multilingual and
  multicultural space in which information can be presented in different
  languages, thus evaluation tools should be in the position to address this
  issue. Furthermore, web content can be transmitted using different character
  encodings and sets (like ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.), which demands
  from the evaluation tools the capacity to handle them.</p> <p>More
  information about this topic can be found in the <abbr
  title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Internationalization Activity
  [<a href="#W3Ci18n">W3Ci18n</a>]. </p> <h4 id="fragments"> 2.1.3
  <abbr>DOM</abbr> document fragments </h4> <p> Many websites are generated
  dynamically by combining code templates with <abbr>HTML</abbr> snippets that
  are created by website editors. Evaluation tools may be integrated into
  Content Management Systems (<abbr>CMS</abbr>) and Integrated Development
  Environments (<abbr>IDE</abbr>) to test these snippets as developers and/or
  editors create them. </p> <p> Usually this is implemented in the evaluation
  tools by creating <abbr>DOM</abbr> <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#ID-B63ED1A3">document
  fragments</a> [<a href="#DOM">DOM</a>] from these snippets. Evaluation tools
  may filter as well the accessibility tests according to their relevance to
  the document fragment. </p> <h4 id="webapp">2.1.4 Dynamic content</h4> <p>
  Web and cloud applications are becoming very frequent on the web. These
  applications present similar interaction patterns as those of desktop
  applications and contain dynamic content and interface updates. Tools that
  evaluate such applications should emulate and record different user actions
  (e.g., activating interface components by clicking with the mouse, swiping
  with the fingers on a touch-screen or using the keyboard) that modify the
  status of the current page or load new resources. The evaluation tool needs
  to define and record these intermediate steps that can be later on
  interpreted by the tool (see section on <a href="#webdriver">web testing
  APIs</a>). </p> <h4 id="cnegotiation">2.1.5 Content negotiation</h4> <p>
  Content negotiation is a characteristic of the <abbr>HTTP(S)</abbr> protocol
  that enables web servers to customize the representation of the
  requested resources according to the demands of the client user agent.
  Because of this, the identification of resources on the web by a Uniform
  Resource Identifier (<abbr>URI</abbr>) alone may not be sufficient. To
  support content negotiation, the testing tool customizes and stores the
  <abbr>HTTP</abbr> headers according to different criteria (see discussion in
</p><ul>
      <li>to fetch a particular variant of the content, such as a mobile
      website;</li>

      <li>to fetch a specific language version of a website;</li>

      <li>to control session and authentication information;</li>

      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul><h4 id="cookies">2.1.6 Cookies</h4><p> A cookie is a name-value pair
  that it is stored by the user-agent [<a
  href="#HTTPCOOKIES">HTTPCOOKIES</a>]. Cookies contain information relevant
  to the website that is being rendered and often include authentication and
  session information exchanged between the client and the server, which as
  seen before may be relevant for content negotiation. </p> <p> A tool that
  supports cookies may store the cookie information provided by the server in
  an <abbr>HTTP</abbr> response an reuse it in subsequent requests. It may
  also allow the user to manually set cookie information to be used with the
  <abbr>HTTP</abbr> requests. </p> <h4 id="authentication">2.1.7
  Authentication</h4> <p> Websites may require authentication (e.g.,
  <abbr>HTTP</abbr> authentication, OpenID, etc.) to control access to given
  parts of the website or to present customized content to authenticated
  users. </p> <p>A tool that supports authentication allows the user to
  provide their credentials beforehand, so that they are used when accessing
  protected resources, or it prompts the user to enter her credentials upon
  the server request. The tool may also support the use of different
  credentials for different parts of a web site.</p> <h4 id="session">2.1.8
  Session tracking</h4> <p> Within <abbr>HTTP</abbr>, session information can
  be used for different purposes like, e.g., implementation of security
  mechanisms (login information, logout a user after a long inactivity period)
  or track the interaction paths of the users. </p> Session information can be
  stored in the user agent local storage, in the session ID in the
  <abbr>URL</abbr> or in a <a href="#cookies">cookie</a>, for example. An
  evaluation tool that supports session tracking should be able to handle
  these different scenarios. <h4 id="crawling">2.1.9 Crawling</h4> <p>Some
  evaluation tools incorporate a web crawler [<a
  href="#WEBCRAWLER">WEBCRAWLER</a>] able to extract hyperlinks out of web
  resources. There are many types of resources on the web that contain
  hyperlinks. The misconception that only <abbr>HTML</abbr> documents contain
  links may lead to wrong results in the evaluation process. </p> <p>A web
  crawler defines an starting point and a set of options. The most common
  features of a web crawler (configuration capabilities) are:</p> <ul>
      <li>Types of content-types crawled (see <a href="#typedoc">section
      2.1.1</a>).</li>

      <li>Capability to define inclusion and exclusion filters. Customers may
      require analysis of concrete parts of the website or may not want to
      include others. Filters can be defined in different ways. For example,
      the user could define regular expressions against which URLs are
      matched, the maximum number resources to be crawled or a maximum
      recursion level in the crawling process.</li>

      <li>Multithreaded crawling. For a large site, it may be important to
      optimize performance by having a tool able to crawl in parallel
      threads.</li>

      <li>Avoidance of duplicate downloads. It is typical from web resources
      to link many times to the same resource (for example, stylesheets, main
      navigation pages, images, etc.). If the crawler is not able to identify
      such issues, it may lead to a great performance loss or to other runtime
      problems.</li>

      <li>Capabilities related to features described in previous sections
      like: content negotiation, authentication support or session
      tracking.</li>
    </ul> <h3 id="testcustom">2.2 Testing functionality</h3> <p>This category
  includes features targeted to the configuration of the tests to be
  performed.</p> <h4 id="filterTests">2.2.1 Selection of evaluation tests</h4>
  <p>Accessibility evaluation tools may offer the possibility to select a
  given subset of evaluation tests or even a single one. A typical example
  could be performing tests to the different conformance levels (A, AA or AAA)
  of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 or selecting individual
  tests for a single technique or common failure.</p> <p>This feature shall
  not be confused with the fact that some tools are focused on testing a
  single characteristic of the web page, like for example, a tool to test
  color contrast.</p> <h4 id="manual">2.2.2 Test modes: automatic,
  semiautomatic and manual</h4> <p> According to the Evaluation and Report
  Language (<abbr>EARL</abbr>) specification [<a href="#EARL10">EARL10</a>],
  there are three types of modes to perform accessibility tests: </p> <ul>
      <li>Automatic - where the test was carried out automatically by the
      software tool without any human intervention.</li>

      <li>Manual - where the test was carried out by human evaluators. This
      includes the case where the evaluators are aided by instructions or
      guidance provided by software tools, but where the evaluators carried
      out the actual test procedure.</li>

      <li>Semi-Automatic - where the test was partially carried out by
      software tools, but human input or judgment was still required to decide
      or help decide the outcome of the test.</li>
    </ul> <p>There are some evaluation tools that support accessibility
  experts by performing semiautomatic or manual tests. This support is
  normally introduced by highlighting in the source code or in the rendered
  document areas which could be originating accessibility problems or where
  human intervention is needed (for instance, to judge the adequacy of a given
  alternative text to an image).</p> <p>Tools may keep provenance information
  (i.e., which part of the report was automatically generated by the tool and
  which was manually modified).</p> <p>Some tools do not declare that they
  only perform automatic testing. Since it is a known fact that automatic
  tests only cover a small set of accessibility issues, full accessibility
  conformance can only be ensured by supporting developers and accessibility
  experts while testing in manual and semiautomatic mode.</p> <h4
  id="ownTests">2.2.3 Development of own tests and test extensions</h4> <p>
  Developers and quality assurance engineers need sometimes to implement their
  own tests. For that purpose, some tools define an <abbr>API</abbr> that
  helps developers to create their own tests, which respond to internal
  demands within their organization. </p> <h4 id="webdriver">2.2.4 Test
  automation</h4> <p> When evaluating accessibility of web sites and
  applications, it is sometimes desirable to create scripts that emulate user
  interaction. With the growing complexity of web applications, there is an
  effort to standardize such interfaces. One of them is, for instance, the
  WebDriver <abbr>API</abbr> [<a href="#WebDriver">WebDriver</a>]. Tools that
  support this API enable developers to write tests that automate the
  application's and the end-users' behaviour.</p> <h3 id="reporting">2.3
  Reporting and monitoring</h3> <p>This category includes features related to
  the ability of the tool to present, store, import, export and compare the
  testing results in different ways. In this section the term report must be
  interpreted in its widest sense. It could be a set of computer screens
  presenting different tables and graphics, a set of icons superimposed on top
  of the content displayed to the user indicating different types of
  errors/warnings, a HTML document or a word processor document summarizing
  the evaluation results, etc.</p> <h4 id="EARLrep">2.3.1 Standard reporting
  languages</h4> <p> Support for standard reporting languages like
  <abbr>EARL</abbr> [<a href="#EARL10">EARL10</a>] is a requirement for many
  users. There are cases where tool users want to exchange results, compare
  evaluation results with other tools, import/export results (for instance,
  when tool A does not test a given problem, but tool B does it), filter
  results, etc. The support for a standardized language facilitates those
  tasks.</p> <p>Although they may not be considered standardized, some tools
  support exporting test results in other common formats like Comma-Separated
  Values (<abbr>CSV</abbr>) [<a href="#CSV">CSV</a>, <a
  href="#TABDATA">TABDATA</a>].</p><h4 id="database">2.3.2 Persistence of
  results</h4> <p>The implementation of monitoring features requires that the
  tool has a persistence layer (a database, for example) where results could
  be stored and retrieved at a later stage to compare different evaluation
  rounds.</p> <h4 id="import">2.3.3 Import/export functionality</h4> <p>In
  many evaluation methodologies, accessibility experts and quality assurance
  engineers use different tools. If the evaluation tool supports import and
  export of test results (for instance, in <abbr>EARL</abbr> format [<a
  href="#EARL10">EARL10</a>], as <abbr>JSON</abbr> [<a href="#JSON">JSON</a>],
  in a <abbr>CSV</abbr> [<a href="#CSV">CSV</a>, <a
  href="#TABDATA">TABDATA</a>] file, etc.), the tool may be easily integrated
  in such environments. </p> <h4 id="customReport">2.3.4 Report
  customization</h4> <p>This feature allows the customization of the resulting
  report according to different criteria, such as the target audience, the
  type of results, the part of the site being analyzed, the type of content,
  etc. This feature may also allow the developer or the accessibility expert
  to add additional comments in the report.</p> <h4 id="aggregation">2.3.5
  Results aggregation</h4> <p>The presentation of evaluation results is
  influenced by the underlying hierarchy of the accessibility techniques with
  guidelines and success criteria. Aggregation is also related to the
  structure of the page. For instance, accessibility errors may be listed for
  a whole web resource or presented for concrete components like images,
  videos, tables, forms, links, etc.</p> <h4 id="conformance">2.3.6
  Conformance</h4> <p>Conformance statements are demanded by many customers to
  assess quickly the status of their website. When issuing such conformance
  statements it is thus necessary to tackle the different types of
  accessibility techniques (i.e., common failures, sufficient techniques,
  etc.) and aggregate results as described in the previous section.</p> <p> As
  described in <a href="#manual">Section 2.2.2</a>, full accessibility
  compliance can only be achieved when manual testing has been implemented.
  </p> <h4 id="repair">2.3.7 Error repair</h4><p> The majority of web
  developers have little or no knowledge about web accessibility. Tools may
  provide together with their reporting capabilities additional information to
  support developers and accessibility experts to correct the accessibility
  problems detected. This information may include examples, tutorials,
  screencasts, pointers to online resources, links to the <abbr
  title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommendations, etc. If the
  evaluation tool is part of an <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool">authoring tool</a> as
  described in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a
  href="#ATAG">ATAG</a>], then the tool will meet its <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#sc_b321">success criterion
  B.3.2.1</a>.</p><p>This feature may include, for example, a guided
  step-by-step wizard which guides the evaluator to correct the problems
  found. Automatic repair of accessibility problems is discouraged, as it may
  originate non-desirable side-effects.</p><h3 id="toolUsage">2.4 Tool
  usage</h3> <p>This section includes characteristics that describe the
  integration into the development and edition workflow of the user or are
  targeted to the customization of different aspects of the tool depending on
  its audience, like for instance, user interface language, user interface
  functionality, user interface accessibility, etc.</p> <h4
  id="workflow">2.4.1 Workflow integration</h4> <p>Accessibility evaluation
  tools present different interfaces, which allow their integration into the
  standard development workflow of the user. The typical ones that can be
  highlighted are the following:</p> <ul>
      <li>Plug-ins or extensions in web browsers. Tools that integrate in web
      browsers may delegate on it the retrieval and rendering of the evaluated
      web content, effectively having as test subject the content the user is
      browsing at that moment. These tools may also present the evaluation
      results on the web browser's viewport or in a separate window.</li>

      <li>Plug-ins for Integrated Development Environments (<abbr>IDE</abbr>s)
      or for Content Management Systems (<abbr>CMS</abbr>). Tools that
      integrate with <abbr>IDE</abbr>s extend their typical capabilities to
      report accessibility errors. The communication possibilities range from
      direct integration into the <abbr>API</abbr> of the tool to access via a
      <abbr>REST</abbr> interface, for example.</li>

      <li>Stand-alone tools: desktop, mobile apps, online tools, etc.</li>

      <li>Integration into bug tracking systems, where developers and experts
      can monitor and trace accessibility problems.</li>

      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul> <h4 id="localization">2.4.2 Localization and
  internationalization</h4> <p>Localization and internationalization are
  important to address worldwide markets. Tool users may not be able to speak
  English and it is necessary to present the user interface (e.g., icons, text
  directionality, <abbr>UI</abbr> layout, units, etc.) and the reports
  customized to other languages and cultures. As pointed out earlier, more
  information about this topic can be found in the <abbr
  title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Internationalization Activity
  [<a href="#W3Ci18n">W3Ci18n</a>] and in [<a href="#I18N">I18N</a>]. </p> <p>
  From the accessibility standpoint, it is recommended to use the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/translations.html">authorized
  translations of the Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines</a>. It must be considered as well that some
  accessibility tests need to be customized to other languages, like for
  instance, such as those related to readability. </p> <h4 id="customAudience">2.4.3
  Functionality customization to different audiences</h4> <p>Typically,
  evaluation tools are targeted to web accessibility experts with a deep
  knowledge of the topic. However, there are also tools that allow the
  customization of the evaluation results or even the user interface
  functionality to other audiences like, for instance:</p> <ul>
      <li>web developers with no or little knowledge of accessibility, who
      need detailed information on how to correct the problems found to
      implement appropriate solutions; or</li>

      <li>web commissioners, who need an aggregated view of the evaluation
      results and tools to support the monitoring of their own websites.</li>
    </ul> <p>The availability of such characteristics must be declared
  explicitly and presented in an adequate way to these target user groups.</p>
  <h4 id="policy">2.4.4 Policy environments</h4> <p>Although there is an
  international effort to harmonize web
  accessibility standards, there are still minor differences in accessibility requirements
  in different countries. The tool should specify in its documentation which
  policy environments are supported. Most of the tools are focused on the
  implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a
  href="#WCAG20">WCAG20</a>], because it is the accessibility standard most commonly referenced in
  policies worldwide. </p> <h4 id="toolAccess">2.4.5 Tool
  accessibility</h4> <p>Accessibility evaluation teams may include people with
  disabilities. To that end, it is relevant that the tool itself can be used
  with different assistive technologies and it is integrated with the
  accessibility <abbr>API</abbr>s of the running operating system. In such
  cases, compliance with the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a
  href="#ATAG">ATAG</a>] becomes an important feature to support both from the
  perspective of the user interface of the tool and the access to its results.
  </p><p>Additionally, when producing reports (for instance, in HTML format),
  it is important that they are accessible as well and in compliance with the
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a
  href="#WCAG20">WCAG20</a>].</p><h2 id="profiles">3 Example profiles of
  evaluation tools</h2> <p class="note">[<strong>Review Note:</strong> The
  editors and the Working Group will welcome suggestions on new profiles from
  tools to extend the listed examples. Furthermore, we welcome feedback on the
  granularity of these profiles and their tabular presentation below.] </p>
  <p>This section presents 3 examples of accessibility evaluation tools. <strong>They
  are provided for illustration purposes and do not represent an existing
  product.</strong> In every subsection, we will highlight some of the key features of
  the tool. The table at the end of the chapter summarizes and complements
  these textual descriptions.</p> 
  <h3 id="plugin">3.1 Example Tool A: Browser plug-in
  evaluating a rendered HTML page</h3> 
  <p> Tool A is a browser plug-in, which
  can perform a quick automatic accessibility evaluation on a rendered
  <abbr>HTML</abbr> page. The main features of the tool are: </p> <ul>
      <li>Testing of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 techniques
      that can be automatically analyzed. The configuration options of the
      tool are limited to perform one of the three conformance levels of WCAG:
      A, AA or AAA.</li>

      <li>Graphical presentation of accessibility issues by means of icons
      that represent different types of problems. By selecting any of the
      icons, the user receives hints on ways to solve the error.</li>

      <li>The tool relies on the capabilities of the browser to support
      cookies, authentication and content negotiation, but it does not offer
      configuration capabilities for these items.</li>

      <li>Since the tool works directly on the browser, it is not integrated
      in the workflow of users who utilize <abbr>IDE</abbr>s in their
      development process.</li>

      <li>The tool allows to export the evaluation results as an
      <abbr>EARL</abbr> report or as a <abbr>CSV</abbr> file.</li>
    </ul> <p><a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> presents an overview of the matching
  features as described in section 2. </p> 
    <h3 id="largeScale">3.2 Example Tool B:
  Large-scale accessibility evaluation tool</h3> 
    <p>Tool B is a large-scale
  accessibility evaluation tool used to analyze web sites with large volumens of content. The main
  features of the tool are: </p> 
    <ul>
      <li>It offers its users the possibility to crawl and evaluate complete
      websites. It also offers the possibility to customize which parts of the
      website are analyzed by defining or excluding different areas of the
      site to be crawled.</li>

      <li>Evaluation results are retained in a relational database and there
      is a dashboard to compare results at different dates. Users can select a
      subset of the crawled pages and complete the automatic and semiautomatic
      tests by inspecting the selected pages and store the results in the
      database.</li>

      <li>The tool analyzes <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr> and
      JavaScript, being able to interpret it dynamically with a rendering
      engine.</li>

      <li>The tool supports authentication, sessions, cookies and content
      negotiation by customizing the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> headers and other
      parameters used in the crawling process.</li>

      <li>The tool performs autonomously the <abbr>WCAG</abbr> automatic
      tests.</li>

      <li>The reports of the tool can be exported as an <abbr>EARL</abbr>
      report (serialized as <abbr>RDF</abbr>/<abbr>XML</abbr>), as a
      spreadsheet and as a <abbr>PDF</abbr> document.</li>

      <li>The tool implements the corresponding interfaces to the
      accessibility <abbr>API</abbr>s of the operating system, being
      accessible to users with disabilities.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p><a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> presents an overview of the matching

  tool are:</p><ul>
      <li>The tool can emulate different user agents running on given mobile
      operating systems. Like tool A, it relies on the capabilities of the
      browser to support cookies, authentication and content negotiation, but
      it does not offer configuration capabilities for these items.</li>

      <li>It shows typical display sizes corresponding to predefined
      smartphones and tablets.</li>

      <li>It supports <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr> and JavaScript,
      providing to the users an implementation of the Web Driver
      <abbr>API</abbr>, supporting automatic and manual evaluation.</li>

      <li>It detects only accessibility issues related to the implementation
      of the accessibility API of the given mobile operating systems.</li>
