  Introduction
</H2>
<P>
This memo discusses appropriate handling of documents containing imagemapped
images in cases where the user-agent cannot display or otherwise process
inline images. Typical examples where this is so are (i) text-only browsers
such as lynx, text-to-speech or braille browsers; (ii) graphical browsers
with disabled image loading; or (iii) information-gathering robots that do
not retrieve or process inlined image files.
<P>
Because imagemapped images are processed by the user agent and a server-side
process, this memo discusses requirements of both these utilities. The focus
is on three issues: appropriate HTML markup, and in particular the use of
ALT attributes with IMG elements; appropriate URL encoding by user agents
of imagemap requests in the absence of user agent-specified image coordinate
data; and the appropriate processing by a server resource of imagemap requests
in the absence of user agent-specified image coordinate data.
<P>
This memo addresses ISMAP and FORM-based imagemaps as specified in the official
specification of HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866) [1].
<P>
Conformance to these recommendations will help provide a standard, graphic-free
interface to Web documents, and will improve the accessiblity of web resources
to users or automated web robots that are unable to view images or process
image-based data.
<H3>
  Review: The ALT Attribute
</H3>
<P>
The ALT attribute to an IMG element provides a text alternative to an image,
used by user-agents that do not process inline images. Consequently, it is
essential that document authors include appropriate ALT text descriptions
if they wish their documents to be usable when images are not displayed.
This is particularly important for images used as hypertext anchors or as
imagemaps. In both these cases, the ALT text should clearly describe the
purpose and intent of the link or of the imagemap and related image map database.
<P>
If an image is purely decorative, it is recommended that an author use an
ALT attribute of the form ALT="" (a null string). This form should never
be used for IMG elements inside an anchor, as some user agents will entirely
hide such an anchor from the user.
<H3>
  Review of Imagemap Instances
</H3>
<P>
There are two cases where imagemaps can be presented to a user-agent. The
first is as an ISMAP image contained within a hypertext anchor. Here, an
image element taking the ISMAP attribute is enclosed within an anchor element,
the anchor element referencing a server resource (often a gateway program)
that processes the coordinate data selected by the user. The second case
is the TYPE="image" INPUT element within an HTML FORM. These cases are discussed
in the next two sections. 
  <HR>
<H2>
  ISMAP Imagemapped Hypertext Anchors
</H2>
<P>
ISMAP imagemapped hypertext anchors take the form:
<PRE>
       &lt;A HREF="http://some.domain.name/path/resource"&gt;
          &lt;IMG SRC="path/to/image.gif" 
               ALT="[alternative text description]" 
               ISMAP &gt;
       &lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
where the ISMAP attribute declares the image to be active, and where the
anchor element enclosing the IMG element specifies the server resource to
which the coordinate data should be sent for processing. A user agent that
can process imagemaps must take the user-selected integer pixel coordinates
(x,y), measured from the upper left hand corner of the image, and send these
to the server using the GET method, appending the selected coordinates to
the URL as the encoded [2,3] query string "x,y". For example:
<PRE>
       http://some.domain.name/path/resource?23,111
</PRE>
<P>
The behaviour in the absence of user-selected coordinate data is at present
unspecified, and is the main subject of this memo.
<H3>
  Processing ISMAP Data by Image-Incapable User Agents and Servers
</H3>
<P>
In the absence of a mechanism for specifying coordinates on the imagemapped
image, a user agent should access the specified URL without any appended
coordinate data: that is, using the URL specified in the anchor element,
without appended query data. For example (following the example markup in
Section 3):
<PRE> 
      http://some.domain.name/path/resource 
</PRE>
<P>
The referenced server resource that processes this request should interpret
a request containing no coordinate data as a request from a user agent that
cannot display or process image files. As a result, the server resource should
return a text-only HTML document providing alternative access to the imagemapped
data: for example, a list of hypertext links, with related descriptions.
<H4>
  Legacy Support
</H4>
<P>
Some current user agents, such as lynx, return the default coordinates (0,0)
when accessing imagemapped anchors in that absence of user agent-selected
coordinate data. This behaviour is deprecated, but authors of server-side
programs that process imagemap data should treat the coordinate pair (0,0)
as equivalent to the absence of coordinate data.
<H3>
  Query String Data Disallowed in Imagemap Anchors
</H3>
<P>
Query string data is forbidden within the URL specifing the server resource
for an ISMAP imagemapped hypertext anchor. Thus, markup of the form
<PRE>
      &lt;A HREF="http://some.domain.name/path/resource?query-data"&gt;
         &lt;IMG SRC="path/image.gif" 
          ALT="[alternative text]" 
          ISMAP &gt;
      &lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
is disallowed. If there is query data within the resource URL, the error
handling mechanism of a user agent should truncate this query data, and append
the appropriate coordinate data (if any) obtained from user input. This error
should be reported to the user, as this change may reflects loss of information.
<H3>
  Fragment Identifiers Allowed in Imagemap Anchors
</H3>
<P>
Fragment identifiers may be appended to the URL specifying the server resource
for an ISMAP hypertext anchor. Thus, markup of the form:
<PRE>
      &lt;A HREF="http://some.domain.name/path/resource#fragment"&gt;
         &lt;IMG SRC="path/image.gif" 
              ALT="[alternative text]" 
              ISMAP &gt;
      &lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
is allowed. Since a fragment identifier is not part of a URL, the user agent
must cache the fragment identifier, strip the string (including the leading
# character) from the URL, and then append, as a query string, the appropriate
coordinate data (if any) obtained from user input. When data are returned
to the user agent from the server, the fragment identifier must be used to
locate the appropriate named location in the returned document, where
appropriate.
<H4>
  NOTE
</H4>
<P>
Many current user-agents do not support fragment identifiers appended to
the URL specifying the server resource for an ISMAP hypertext anchor. 
  <HR>
<H2>
  TYPE=image INPUT Elements Within a FORM
</H2>
<P>
Within a FORM, an author can declare an input element of the form
<PRE>
      &lt;INPUT TYPE="IMAGE" 
             NAME="tstname" VALUE="testvalue" 
             SRC="path/image.gif"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
This specifies an image resource to be displayed, in which the user can select
pixel coordinates (x,y) measured from the upper left hand corner of the image.
This input element type is analogous to a button of the form TYPE="submit"
-- when the user selects coordinates in the TYPE="image" element, the form
as a whole is immediately submitted, with the image coordinates being passed
to the server as an URL query string field of the form:
<PRE>
      tstname.x=x_coord&amp;tstname.y=y_coord
</PRE>
<P>
Here "tstname.x" and "tstname.y" are the variable names composed by combining
the encoded [1] INPUT element NAME attribute value with the strings ".x"
and ".y", and where "x_coord" and "y_coord" are the positive integer x and
y pixel coordinates selected by the user, relative to the upper left-hand
corner of the image. The VALUE attribute is unused, and is currently ignored
by most user agents.
<P>
If the FORM is submitted without the user selecting image coordinates, for
example by selecting a TYPE="input" element, then no data associated with
the TYPE="image" input element are included with the message sent by the
user agent. the the URL query string due to this element contains no data
This is analogous to an unselected TYPE="checkbox" input element.
<H3>
  Processing TYPE=image Elements by Image-Incapable Agents
</H3>
<P>
If a user agent incapable of processing images (for whatever reason) submits
a FORM via the TYPE="image" input element, then the encoded string from the
TYPE="image" element should take the (URL encoded) form:
<PRE>
        tstname.x=&amp;tstname.y=
</PRE>
<P>
That is, there should be no coordinate data passed to the server (the coordinate
data are null strings). The server resource processing the FORM data can
use the presence of "tstname.x" and "tstsname.y" NAMEs, and the absence of
coordinate data VALUEs, to infer that the user agent is not capable of processing
images, but that the user did select the TYPE="image" input element. If possible,
the server resource can then return a FORM more appropriate to the user agent's
capabilities.
<P>
Some user agents currently send encoded data of the form
<PRE>
       tstname.x=0&amp;tstname.y=0
</PRE>
<P>
when they are unable to process the image. This behavior is deprecated, but
writers of server-side programs that process FORM data resulting from
TYPE="image" INPUT elements should where possible treat the coordinate pair
(0,0) as equivalent to the absence of coordinate data,
<H4>
  Recommended Use of the VALUE Attribute
</H4>
<P>
It is recommended that authors use the VALUE attribute to contain a text
alternative to the active image. User agents incapable of processing images
can use this text in place of the image, providing some guidance to the user.
Ideally, however, the document author should provide an alternative
representation of the active image to such users, for example a series of
NAMEd TYPE="submit" buttons.
