<p>This document is a glossary of terms used in other documents produced by
the Device Independence Working Group (DIWG). Details of the entire series of

Independence Activity</a> home page.</p>

<h2><a name="status" id="status">Status of this Document</a></h2>

<p><em>This section describes the status of this document at the time of its
publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current
W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be
found in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C technical reports index</a>

<p>This glossary is published and maintained by <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/di/Group/">DIWG</a>(member only link), part of the <a

<p>The glossary is maintained as a Working Draft of a future W3C Note. This
allows it to be revised at appropriate intervals. Updates take place in
support of new work being carried out by the DIWG. In general, it is
inappropriate to use W3C Working Drafts as formal reference material or to
cite them as other than "work in progress". Because this document is subject
to change, other authors wishing to cite definitions in this glossary should
exercise caution. Updates to the glossary are made in such a way as to avoid
invalidating references, as long as those references conform to the
mechanisms described in the section <a
href="#sec-using-and-maintaining">Using and Maintaining the Glossary</a>.
However, in support of its work, DIWG may need to modify definitions in newer
versions of this document.</p>

<p>A list of current public W3C Working Drafts can be found at <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">http://www.w3.org/TR</a>.</p>

<p>Publication as a Working Draft does not imply endorsement by the W3C
Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or
obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this
document as other than work in progress.</p>

      "transparent proxy" is a proxy that does not modify the <a

      proxy authentication and identification. A "non-transparent proxy" is a

      added service to the <a href="#def-user-agent">user agent</a>, such as
      group annotation services, media type transformation, protocol
      reduction, or anonymity filtering. Except where either transparent or

<h2><a name="sec-using-and-maintaining" id="sec-using-and-maintaining">A
Using and Maintaining the Glossary</a></h2>

<p>This section documents the way in which the glossary should be used from
other DIWG documents. It also documents how changes are to be made to the
glossary itself in a way that will not invalidate links to the
definitions.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-using" id="sec-using">A.1 Using the Glossary</a></h3>

<p>Every definition in the glossary has an associated anchor. As a
consequence every definition can be directly referenced externally from other
documents. Such references should use the public URL associated with the DIWG
glossary. For the latest version of the glossary, this has been established
as <br />
<br />
<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/">http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/</a></p>

<p>Dated versions of the glossary will appear at URLs in the form of the
following <br />
<br />
<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-di-gloss-20030825/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-di-gloss-20030825/</a></p>

<p>To refer to a particular definition, a document should create a URL based
on the appropriately dated, public URL and the fragment identifier for the
definition. Fragment identifiers consist of the definition name, in
lowercase, with words separated by dashes and prefixed by
<strong>def</strong>. For example, the fragment identifier for the definition
of <strong>User Agent</strong> is <strong>def-user-agent</strong>, and for
<strong>Navigation</strong> is <strong>def-navigation</strong>. The URL to
use for the definition of Navigation for the dated version mentioned above
would be: <br />
<br />
<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-di-gloss-20030825/#def-navigation">http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-di-gloss-20030825/#def-navigation</a></p>

<p>One important guarantee for documents that reference the glossary is that
the fragment identifier for a given definition never changes. If, for
example, a new version of a particular definition is needed, the older
version will be retained within the glossary with its fragment identifier.
The new version will be given a new identifier. The process used to maintain
the glossary and to retain this uniqueness of definition identifiers is
described in the following section.</p>

<p>In addition to referring directly to individual definitions in the
glossary, documents that use it should include a reference to the dated
version in use in their References section. The following is an example of
such a reference:</p>
<dl>
  <dt class="label"><a name="ref-di-gloss" id="ref-di-gloss"></a> Glossary of
  Terms for Device Independence (version used for definitions)</dt>
    <dd><a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-di-gloss-20030825/"><cite>Glossary
      of Terms for Device Independence</cite></a>, Rhys Lewis, 2003. W3C
      Working Draft available at:
      http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-di-gloss-20030825/</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="sec-maintaining" id="sec-maintaining">A.2 Maintaining the
Glossary</a></h3>

<p>The DIWG glossary will remain a public working draft. This reflects the
need to update it as new work is carried out in DIWG. The need to revise the
glossary, and in particular the potential requirement to revise definitions,
leads to a need for a mechanism that can allow older documents to refer
unambiguously to older revisions of particular definitions.</p>

<p>Once a version of the glossary has been published, the definitions it
contains have fragment identifiers that must not be changed. As new
definitions are added they are given new identifiers. This poses no issues
for documents authored before the new definitions were published. However,
when a definition is revised, it is vital that older documents that used the
old version are still valid. They are protected by the use of version
identification within the fragment identifiers. In addition, the old versions
of definitions are maintained in <a href="#sec-previous-versions">Appendix
B</a> of the glossary.</p>

<p>To revise a glossary definition, the following steps must be carried
out:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The existing definition, complete with fragment identifier, must be
    copied to <a href="#sec-previous-versions">Appendix B</a>.</li>
  <li>The definition must be updated within the main part of the
  glossary.</li>
  <li>The revised definition must be given an updated fragment identifier
    constructed by adding a version number where none exists, or incrementing
    it if one already exists. For example, if the fragment identifier before
    revision were <strong>#def-navigation</strong> it would become <strong><a
    name="def-navigation-v2"
    id="def-navigation-v2">#def-navigation-v2</a></strong>. Alternatively, if
    the fragment identifier before revision were
    <strong>#def-navigation-v7</strong> it would become
    <strong>#def-navigation-v8</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>All</strong> references to the definition within the glossary
    itself must be updated to refer to this new fragment identifier. In
    addition, all definitions that refer to the revised definition must be
    reviewed to see whether they need modification because of the change. If
    so, this same procedure must be applied those definitions and new
    versions must be created.</li>
  <li>The old definition that has been moved to <a
    href="#sec-previous-versions">Appendix B</a> must have a reference added
    that refers to the newer definition in the body of the glossary. As an
    example, the reference for an old version of the definition of Navigation
    might include the reference: <br />
    <br />
    "This definition has been superseded. There is a newer definition of <a
    href="#def-navigation-v2">Navigation</a>". <br />
    <br />
    Notice that <em>these</em> links should <strong>not</strong> be updated
    when a new version of a definition is added. By not changing them, they
    form a chain through the versions of the definition from the one
    referenced by the external document up to the latest version.</li>
</ol>
