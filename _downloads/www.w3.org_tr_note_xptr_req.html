<h2><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

<p>This document presents requirements for the XPointer language.
XPointer provides ways to directly identify any node, data, or
selection in any XML document by describing its structure and
context. An identified data location is called a
&quot;target.&quot; The XPointer specification is particularly
meant to enable hyperlinks to identify any such data, regardless
of whether there is (or even could be) an ID on the target or
not. The XPointer specification is now being developed in the
XML-Linking Working Group, building on Working Drafts developed
in the XML Working Group.</p>

<p>Because the XPointer language must refer to structural parts
of XML documents, those structures must be explicit. Document
structure specifications such as DOM and the XML Information Set
may wish to consider the XPointer requirements in order to insure
interoperability when used with XPointer and XLink.</p>

<h1><a name="MinReq">Specific (minimal) XPointer requirements</a></h1>

<p>This section lays out specific minimal functional requirements
for the XPointer specification that aim for an appropriate
balance of completeness, expressiveness, extensibility, and
simplicity. These requirements also apply to any higher-end
location-specification language to the extent that it shares some
of its functionality objectives with XPointer. Following the
specific requirements is a section on background and rationale
underlying them.</p>

<h2><a name="X.completeness">A: Completeness requirements</a></h2>

<p>This section of the requirements involves the type and variety
of data locations, or &quot;targets&quot;, that an XPointer must
be able to identify.</p>

<p>These requirements make frequent reference to XML information
objects such as elements, attributes, PIs, and characters. The
formal definition of these objects, their relationships such as
ordering, containment, and attribution, and their precise
correspondence to XML syntax constructs are the domain of the XML
Information Set Working Group. For more detail on the
relationship, see the XML Linking Working Group's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-xptr-infoset-liaison">Liaison Statement</a>.</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>XPointers must identify XML information objects, rather
        than necessarily their expressions in the raw XML syntax
        of a given file.</p>
        <p>For example, an XPointer can identify
        an element but not a tag, and (potentially) an attribute;
        but not the equal-sign or quotations that expressed it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>For any single element, character in content, or PI in an
        XML document, it must be possible to create at least one
        XPointer that specifically identifies it.</p>
        <p>This includes
        special processing instructions such as the XML
        declaration and the stylesheet-attachment PI.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>For any single attribute or character in an attribute
        value in an XML document, it must be possible to create
        at least one XPointer that specifically identifies it.</p>
        <p>[There
        is not consensus on whether identification of attributes
        is required. DOM does not presently provide a built-in
        way to get from an attribute to the elements bearing it;
        on the other hand RDF defines an attribute-based
        representations for which omitting attributes may pose
        problems. The WG seeks additional input on this issue.]</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>For any contiguous selection such as could be clicked or
        dragged by a user in a typical view of the document, it
        must be possible to create at least one XPointer that
        specifically identifies it. This includes point targets
        such as typically selected by a mouse click, entire
        characters, and synchronous and asynchronous spans, as in
        typical word processors and browsers.</p>
        <p>This is
        necessary to model simple everyday user selection, and to
        support the first interface many applications want to
        build: the ability for the user to make a selection in
        the usual way and attach a link to or from it, an
        annotation or bookmark to it, insert it in a path, and so
        on. If users could only select or link whole elements,
        the intuitive &quot;select/act&quot; interface would no
        longer correspond to the system's actual behavior, and
        thus become very confusing.</p>
        <p>[Implementor note: Such a selection may include only
        part of various elements: this is most obvious with a
        selection that includes the end of one element and the
        start of the next, but is also true relative to the
        ancestors of any element. Such a selection may be
        considered to include information about attributes and
        boundary locations for elements that include some but not
        all of the selected range. In the example just given,
        there would thus be access to the attributes and boundary
        locations of both the elements that are partly included,
        even though neither is fully &quot;in&quot; the span; but
        not, say, of a containing DIV. See <a href="#Broo88">Brooks
        (1988)</a> for an extensive analysis of the semantics and
        user interface requirements for selecting and editing in
        tree-structured documents.]</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>For any point immediately preceding or following any
        character of content, and for any point immediately
        inside or outside the beginning or end of any element, or
        PI, it must be possible to create at least one XPointer
        that specifically identifies it.</p>
        <p>This is required
        because it is a standard part of user selection
        semantics, and to provide an unambiguous way to express
        targets for myriad other application purposes: inserting
        or pasting, recording the scope of change or version
        information, and so on. For example, one may wish to
        specify the location in content immediately preceding a
        given PI or sub-element, not only the PI or sub-element
        itself (especially small elements such as italicized
        words), in order to unambiguously specify a cursor
        location, the end of a user selection, the destination of
        a link, etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>[There is not consensus on whether this is a short-term
        requirement] the XPointer specification must provide a
        way to identify targets that include multiple,
        potentially discontiguous data portions.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="X.expressiveness">B: Expressiveness requirements</a></h2>

<p>These requirements involve the type and variety of XPointers
that can be used to identify a target, which is how the language
achieves greater robustness, reusability, and clarity to humans,
as described in more detail below). Fulfilling the completeness
requirements above does not guarantee fulfilling the
expressiveness requirements stated here. These are a different
but equally important class of requirement. Indeed it is easy to
design a target-rich system, but it would be much more prone to
breakage, and far less intuitive and readable to humans (even if
it managed to have fewer constructs or be terser, such as the
extreme case of a pair of byte offsets into XML source).</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must utilize information
        structures users can be expected to perceive or
        understand in documents, such as elements, attributes,
        PIs, characters, and strings; and to well-known
        relationships such as containment, siblings, and so on.
        The XPointer specification is not primarily concerned
        with machine-oriented concepts such as offsets, absolute
        nesting depth, and so on.</p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must provide for identifying
        targets of specified names and types, for example by XML
        IDs, XML PI targets, and element type names. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must (if Xpointers to
        attributes are included) provide for identifying an
        attribute by name, given an element it is on. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must provide a way for
        specific XPointers to express that a singleton target is
        expected. For example, when identifying an element by an
        XML ID attributes or other potential &quot;key&quot;
        constructs. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must provide for identifying
        elements, PIs, characters, and (if supported) comments,
        by their ordered position in the document structure
        relative to other targets that fulfill specified
        conditions. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must provide ways to constrain
        targets by specifying conditions on them, such as element
        type, attribute values, and the presence of particular
        content strings.</p>
        <p>For example, identifying a <tt>SECTION
        </tt>that contains an <tt>ABSTRACT </tt>with <tt>TYPE=FULL</tt>,
        rather than merely an <tt>ABSTRACT</tt>; or being unable
        to test the <tt>ABSTRACT</tt>'s attribute but still
        identify the <tt>SECTION</tt> as the intended target. Or,
        constraining a target to be directly or indirectly within
        a broader target, or to precede or follow it among the
        children of a common containing element.</p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification should make clear a way that
        it can be extended to support testing datatype-specific
        conditions when XML Datatypes are later available through
        the work of the XML Schemas Working Group.</p>
        <p>For example,
        once it is possible to know which attributes or content
        strings constitute integers, date, or real numbers, it
        should be clear how to extend the language to accommodate
        appropriate comparisons within its conditional
        constructs. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must provide a way to specify
        what version of a target resource is intended to be
        identified. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must define how it works in
        relation to XML namespaces. Since an element or attribute
        name can be used as part of characterizing locations in
        an XPointer expression, the meaning of those names must
        be unambiguous.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="X.robustness">C: Robustness requirements</a></h2>

<ol>
    <li><p>It must be possible, but not mandatory, to create
        XPointers that can be tested for whether they identify
        &quot;the same&quot; target when followed as they did
        when created.</p><p>For example, this may be accomplished by
        providing a checksum of the destination data. This
        massively improves robustness because you can detect when
        a link has broken (although it cannot prevent link
        breakage from ever happening). [There is not consensus on
        whether this requirement should be addressed within
        XPointer or XLink]. </p></li>
    <li><p> All XPointers must survive purely mechanical changes to
        the target resource.</p> <p>For example, changing between
        single and double quote characters around attributes or
        between CR, LF, and CRLF for line-ends; inserting
        extraneous whitespace inside <i>tags</i> (for example,
        between the element type name and the attributes, or
        around attribute equal-signs, etc); re-ordering
        attributes; swapping between CDATA marked sections and
        entities for escaping tag opens; or rearranging the
        division between entities.</p>
        <p>Such change are not considered to change the logical
        information structure, and should not prevent an XPointer
        from being interpreted as pointing to the same data.
        However, any change that touches the structure may change
        the destination of the XPointer, and can be (see the
        preceding requirement) caught. Just what changes are
        considered mechanical, is to be worked out in cooperation
        with the XML Information Set Working Group. </p></li>
    <li><p>XPointer must attempt to avoid dependencies on character
        set and internationalization issues, such as its
        definition of &quot;character&quot;. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must enumerate any
        dependencies on the presence of a DTD or schema, and
        attempt to minimize such in order to facilitate
        interoperability of XPointers across DTD-supporting and
        non-DTD-supporting XML environments.</p>
        <p>For example, an
        XPointer that identifies a target in part via an
        attribute, may not be interpretable if the target is in a
        non-standalone XML document being processed by a
        non-DTD-supporting parser. This is inherent in XML, but
        needs to be made clear in the XPointer specification. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must be clear about what
        errors may arise, and what they mean. To that end, it
        should attempt to enumerate any dependencies on the XML
        Information Set. <p>In particular, the XPointer
        specification must clearly define the meaning when a
        syntactically correct XPointer does not resolve to any
        data object. [There is no consensus as of this writing on
        whether that is necessarily an error]. There are security
        issues to consider in this, such as that distinguishing
        &quot;data does not exist&quot; from &quot;data access
        not authorized&quot; may itself compromise security.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="X.user">D: General user requirements</a></h2>

<ol>
    <li><p>XPointers must be reasonably user-readable and
        user-writable, particularly for cases likely to be
        commonly needed by beginning and intermediate users.
        Syntax must scale smoothly, not abruptly with increasing
        complexity. </p></li>
    <li><p>The XPointer specification must provide for re-use of
        XPointers by other XPointers. [There is not consensus
        that this is a short-term requirement, though there is
        consensus on its desirability in principle.]</p>
        <p>For
        example, it should be possible to express a generic
        XPointer such as &quot;the following sibling of type
        T&quot;, and then write other XPointers that re-use it,
        such as &quot;the first ABSTRACT within whatever (that
        xpointer) points to. This is particularly useful to
        create generic pointers to relative rather than absolute
        targets, and to support functionality like the HTML BASE
        feature.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="X.syntax">E: Mechanical and syntactic requirements</a></h2>

<ol>
    <li><p>XPointers must identify <i>locations</i> in data, not
        merely the data <i>at</i> those locations. <p>A user who
        selects a word or string in a document and attaches a
        link to it via an XPointer, may be very unhappy if they
        follow the link and get just the phrase: they want the
        target data <i>with access to its context.</i> This is
        why the HTML mechanism of scrolling to a target element
        by appending &quot;#&quot; and its name to the document's
        URL is the way it is: literally returning just the anchor
        is usually not enough. From a location one can get the
        context data when needed; from data alone one cannot
        derive a unique location when needed.</p>
        <p>As an example, a DOM handle to an XML information set
        object such as an element, would be one way to identify
        the object in context; while generating a string of
        content and/or markup that contains no reference to the
        original context, would not. </p></li>
    <li><p>XPointer syntax must not require excessive escaping when
        XPointers are embedded in URLs and external identifiers.
        That is, XPointer must not go nuts with punctuation
        marks. This requirement must be balanced with the next
        one, of course.</p>
        <p>This is to preserve readability in raw
        form (which is of minimal importance, as in XML), and to
        reduce multi-escaping errors such as when pasting between
        external identifiers and URLs, passing URLs through
        scripts, typing URLs in raw, etc, etc.</p>
        <p>Note: There are two kinds of escaping to be
        considered: XML escaping such as for ampersand, angle
        brackets, and quotes when XPointers appear within XML
        documents; and URL escaping such as %20 for space, when
        they appear in URLS. </p></li>
    <li><p>When embedded in URLs, XPointers must be correctly
        processed by current Web software such as servers and
        user agents.</p>
        <p>This obviously does not mean that existing
        software magically becomes XPointer-aware; merely that
        XPointer syntax must survive generic URL processing such
        as performed by servers. </p></li>
    <li><p>XPointers must use syntax in ways that are appropriate
        and familiar for the constructs we use them for.</p>
        <p>For
        example &quot;+&quot;, if used, should mean addition, not
        variable substitution. For example, operations from
        languages that deal with XML-like data (ordered trees of
        repeatable typed objects, with document-scope unique
        names) would provide applicable syntax, while languages
        that deal with XML-unlike data (such as unordered sets of
        non-repeatable or untyped objects and names) would not. </p></li>
    <li><p>XPointer syntax must be readily generalizable to more
        powerful specifications needed in the future. This means
        we can't use up all the syntax now, or take up all the
        simple syntax for the one or two simplest cases at the
        cost of a massive increment of complexity to get any
        further. </p></li>

<h2><a name="X.the.princeton.band">F: Non-requirements</a></h2>

<p>This section collect potential requirements that have been
considered and rejected, at least for the initial version of the
XPointer specification.</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>For any entire comment in an XML document, it must be
        possible to create at least one XPointer that
        specifically identifies it. </p></li>
    <li><p>Comments could be included in order to maintain the
        ability to identify <i>any</i> node in the information
        structure, assuming that XML Information Structure can
        include comments. There do not seem to be compelling use
        cases; critical information should not, in principle, be
        embedded in comments. Also, XML does not require that
        comments be passed back to applications at all, and so
        including them in XPointer would introduce ambiguity
        here.</p>
        <p>If comments were supported, The XPointer
        specification would have to define counting and perhaps
        other operations such that XPointers not directly
        pointing at comments would work regardless of whether the
        application had gotten comments from the XML parser or
        not.</p></li>

<h1><a name="Introduction">Background and Rationale</a></h1>

<p>This document defines specific requirements for the XPointer
specification, beyond necessary but &quot;apple pie&quot;
requirements such as &quot;completeness&quot;,
&quot;clarity&quot;, or &quot;brevity&quot;. These more detailed
functional requirements are intended to facilitate
decision-making during development of the Proposed Reccomendation
from the established Working Draft.</p>

<p>For XPointers to interoperate, they must be defined in terms
of an explicit and consistent conceptual structure. For example,
any construct involving child numbers breaks badly if one
application can counts PIs, comments, or some other objects as
children, while another doesn't: an XPointer interpreted by the
two would identify different places, which is unacceptable.
Because a consistent structure is required for XPointers to
interoperate, constraints on the conceptual information structure
for XML are discussed in a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-xptr-infoset-liaison">related
liaison paper</a>.

<h2><a name="Kinds">Kinds of pointing</a></h2>

<p>A system for identifying data locations can be characterized
along two basic axes: The <i>set of targets</i> it can express,
versus the <i>set of methods</i> it uses to express them.</p>

<p><a name="#term.range.of.targets"></a>The first axis, the <i>range of
targets</i>, involves the extent or range of things the system
can identify at all: just documents as wholes, just elements,
individual characters, strings, etc. URLs leading to HTML
generally can identify whole documents (typically files), as well
as named A elements that the author specifically provided; but
not other elements, words, or any other kind of selection or
structure in HTML (unless of course you program via CGI, server
plug-ins, etc. -- which not surprisingly can do anything any
computer program can do). </p>

<p><a name="#term. range.of.descriptions"></a>The second axis, the <i>range
of descriptions</i> available for doing the pointing, involves
how well a system can express the intent of the pointer as
distinct from what it pointed to. For example, saying &quot;the
first footnote with author='Smith' rather than &quot;element
3735928559&quot;. Weakness of a system on this axis would limits
the mean of expressing what you actually <i>mean</i>, as opposed
to just what you <i>got,</i> even if the result happens to be
identical. This would have the same problems as a human language
that tried to remove all synonyms, or a mathematical model that
tried to define &quot;integer&quot; by listing all integers.
While a grand, even elegant idea at first glance, it is
inadequate.</p>

<p>This distinction is the most crucial to any data
identification specification. It is usually quite easy to achieve
any desired level of target power, and extremely trivial to
implement. For example, a pair of byte offsets into an HTML file
has very high target power: it can point to any element, any tag,
any attribute (name, value, or whole), any character, and any
string regardless of how it crosses element boundaries.
Generally, the target power is even too high, because most offset
pairs point to ill-formed data chunks for which users would
likely never need a pointer at all (such as &quot;<tt>me='w</tt>&quot;
in &quot;<tt>&lt;p name='wow'&gt;</tt>&quot;). </p>

<p>At the same time, a pair of byte offsets has almost no
descriptive power: the offsets to a particular paragraph,
footnote, citation, or other element instance, give no hint of
what they are: they're just two numbers. There is nothing in such
a system that makes such a reference any easier, more robust,
more readable, or simpler to create than an absurd one (such as
from the middle of the name of the TYPE attribute of some element
to the middle of the 27th word of its 946th descendant).
Low-description systems fail to reflect the important fact that
some things are ubiquitous, coherent, and highly valuable, but
others are bizarre, ill-formed, or nearly useless. </p>

<p>Some other models have the opposite characteristics: IDs have
fairly low target power (you can only link to things that have
them, and only whole elements can have them), but very high
descriptive power (you can say exactly what you mean, since IDs
typically express a notion of objects that have true names). This
is why they are so highly robust, but not very general. </p>

<p>These two axes are not necessarily a tradeoff: a system can
also have neither or both. For example, numbering all the
elements of a document in order and using that number, is low to
moderate on <i>both</i> kinds of power (though it affords some
very nice optimizations for implementors). And a system of
structural identifiers that mirrors the structure of information
directly can be quite high in both kinds of power. </p>

<p>Systems with high target power but low description power have
other problems, such as compromising robustness: they break far
more easily and, even worse, make it is nearly impossible to <i>detect</i>
failures. They also lack reusability: an identifier created for
one context can generally be used in other contexts only if it is
highly descriptive. A common SGML and XML example is a document
available in multiple languages (or multiple drafts or editions).
If you assign the same IDs to corresponding elements in each
version, it is trivial to re-use links with any version, or even
with several at once (say, for parallel text display or
comparison); a system that can utilize ancestor, child, and
sibling relationships can frequently get the same result even
with few IDs around; a purely target-rich system cannot./p&gt; </p>

<p>Many user comments on the existing WDs and implementations
have advocated increasing both kinds of power, but especially
description power: to describe the intended destination in more
abstract, information-oriented or human-oriented terms, rather
than only in terms of geometry or tree position. Taking best
advantage of more descriptive pointing may requires at least very
slight knowledge of tagging practices, but description helps even
without such knowledge; for almost any XML it is likely that
pointing to an ID-less element by pointing to some nearby element
<i>with</i> an ID, and stepwise from there to the final target
element, is a good improvement over pointing merely via
child-numbers all the way down from the document root element. In
many XML applications schemas and use requirements -- such as a
transaction record, a bibliography, an RDF file, etc. -- provide
much more information that enable automatic construction of
highly clear, descriptive pointers -- if the language allows them
to exist at all. For example, a pointer to the last transaction
in a set, or the one with the highest price, is clear and
unambiguous. In general, finding an element with a given ID, or a
given kind of element type or context, or elements with certain
combinations of simple characteristics in terms of types,
attributes, tree relationships to other characterized targets,
etc. add robustness.</p>

<h2><a name="Lure">On minimalist pointing</a></h2>

<p>Target-rich pointing may appear at first glance to be all that
is needed for XPointer. This is probably because
'select/create-link' is the first interface some applications
will implement, and because even completely non-descriptive
pointing can trivially support that interface. However, there are
many other applications for XPointer. If the criterion is merely
ability to point somehow, that would logically lead to byte
offsets as the simplest solution; but this is widely agreed to be
absurd. While for one specific application scenario that might
barely suffice, the situation is clearly more complex; it is
analogous to some other familiar situations: </p>

<ul>
    <li><p>One-way, single-ended links (like HTML &lt;A&gt;) are
        sometimes thought to be the sum total of hypertext
        requirements. They, too, can achieve good power in terms
        of what they <i>can</i> express, because you can always
        decompose multi-ended links, bi-directional links, link
        typing, and other phenomena into more complicated (but
        non-standardized) structures of lots of &lt;A&gt;s; but
        they are weak in descriptive power, since you must resort
        to circuitous ways to accomplish some desired ends. </p></li>
    <li><p>Word processors typically implement procedural formatting
        before descriptive: &quot;after all, you can get all the
        required formatting effects without stylesheets or
        unpredictable sets of tags, right?&quot; This is
        precisely the same distinction at issue here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Such &quot;completeness&quot; arguments may be true as far as
they go, but are not sufficient: much more is required for an
adequate solution in all these cases. Descriptive power
requirements matter because human usability requires other
features such as readability, indirection, re-use, ability to
change things without countless manual repairs, and generally
better robustness in the face of change. Thus, more descriptive
pointing is a vastly better solution.</p>

<p>Radically minimalist pointing has never been contemplated in
XPointer, and should not be. It is extremely easy to implement,
and attractive for that reason (although descriptive pointing has
also been repeatedly shown not to be hard). But at the same time,
minimalist pointing has a number of inherent limitations that
taken together make descriptive pointing necessary:</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Minimalist pointers are not, in general, easily <b>interpretable
        </b>by humans. Large precise integers, or vectors of
        smaller ones, are just not as understandable to humans as
        &quot;the 5th chapter past here&quot; or &quot;chapter 4
        section 2 paragraph 5&quot;; the latter are common,
        familiar notions. </p></li>
    <li><p>Minimalist pointing decreases the <b>ability to achieve
        robustness.</b> This is because with
        minimalist/procedural pointing, you can only refer to
        what you <i>got,</i> not to what you wanted. This is
        equivalent so long as nothing changes; but as soon as
        something changes (as is frequent), minimalist pointers
        break far more readily than descriptive ones. There is a
        scale of robustness, and only by providing a range of
        descriptive pointing techniques can link authors (human
        or otherwise) take advantage of it. </p></li>
    <li><p>Minimalist pointing is less appropriate for dealing with
<b>dynamically-generated
        HTML</b> or XML, such as database extractions or
        dynamically-assembled documents (an increasingly common
        scenario). This is because such information is likely to
        be changed in small-scale but widespread ways (replacing
        the stock ticker or visit counter field, etc), and such
        minor changes will commonly break minimalist pointers to
        unchanged surrounding data, but not break descriptive
        pointers. Also, such data typically has systematic
        regularities that make automated construction of highly
        descriptive pointers easy and highly robust -- but only
        if the pointing language lets such pointers exist. </p></li>
    <li><p>Minimalist pointers have virtually no potential for <b>re-use.</b>
        They cannot describe relative locations, such as
        &quot;the next chapter&quot; or &quot;the chapter 5
        milestones tags earlier&quot;, and so cannot be re-used
        in multiple contexts (see <a href="#DeRo89">DeRose 1989</a>
        for more on link reuse). If pointers had too little
        descriptive power, even a trivial &quot;next slide&quot;
        link in presentations could not be made generic: only an
        explicit, separate, tediously different &quot;next
        slide&quot; link on every slide; which again seems
        absurd. It is hard to imagine plausible situations where
        a non-descriptive link could be usefully re-used
        (&quot;37 elements earlier&quot;???). </p></li>
    <li><p>Minimalist pointers generally provide no selection of
        targets consisting of <b>multiple locations,</b> such as
        the set of all elements of a given type, the set of all
        characters within a given element, etc.</p>
        <p>This is a more
        severe problem than it seems, because it impacts any
        XPointers that involve stepwise specifications (sometimes
        called &quot;location ladders&quot;), even simple ones
        such as &quot;the SEC that contains an ABSTRACT&quot;. If
        multiple locations are ruled out even for intermediate
        results in an addressing expression, then such pointers
        are ruled out even when they would end up at a single
        node. This is because the evaluator would find a lot of
        SEC elements first, and only then be able to go on to
        pick the one that is the final result. If the
        implementation must support multiple results in
        intermediate steps, the savings sometimes claimed for
        ruling them out largely disappears. </p></li>
    <li><p>Minimalist pointers are commonly limited to identifying a
        single whole element, a single point or character, or at
        best a string (offsets can &quot;sort of&quot; point to
        more, but really only point to byte ranges that may,
        sometimes, correspond to these units). <b>Normal user
        selections</b> cannot be modeled.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Nature">The nature of the distinction</a></h2>

<p>Many of these differences arise from a single underlying
cause: namely, inadequate descriptive power. A non-descriptive or
trivially descriptive pointer language might in theory be able to
point to all the same objects as a descriptive language. However,
linking to &quot;the 3rd child of the 4th child of the root&quot;
does not mean the same thing as linking to &quot;ID chap5&quot;
or &quot;the element immediately preceding the ABSTRACT&quot;.
They may happen to be the same thing on one day, for one version
of one location in one dataset; but the meaning is not the same.</p>

<p>Note: This fundamental distinction is so important that it has
names and entire literatures within many fields of study.
Linguists call such cases de dicto/de re ambiguities; logicians
and mathematicians call them intensional vs. extensional
specification; computer scientists call them shallow and deep (or
weak and strong) equality; markup theorists call them procedural
and declarative markup. In all these fields, providing formal
systems that support only one of the two cases is a classic
error.</p>

<h2><a name="Robustness">Robustness issues</a></h2>

<p>Another example of the difference in power of descriptive over
minimalist pointing involves robustness (that is, pointers that
have a good chance of pointing to the same place even after the
document has been edited in various ways). It has occasionally
been suggested that depending on usage scenarios, TREELOCs (which
specify a node by giving the sequence of child-numbers to walk
down to it) might be just as robust as IDs (unique names), or
even more so. While this is true in theory, I find it
unconvincing because</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Although one can create such scenarios in theory, they
        are not at all typical of existing practice. </p></li>
    <li><p>IDs require a &quot;positive option&quot; (editing the
        ID) to break them, but TREELOCs break readily (even
        editing a far-distant part of the document) without the
        user having to do anything local or specific to break
        them. </p></li>
    <li><p>Most crucial: with IDs or other descriptive methods,
        authors <i>can</i> create a work practice under which
        they can edit without breaking links. Software can even
        help, for example by tracking deleted IDs so they are not
        accidentally re-used. With TREELOC there is <i>no</i>
        such possibility at all: you cannot manage an editing
        process so that a given node is always the third child,
        even after you inserted a child before it. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So although it is <i>possible to fail</i> under either
approach if you make all the worst possible choices, that does
not make the approaches equally robust. This is because only with
the ID approach is it <i>possible to protect yourself</i> even if
you make all the best choices.</p>

<h2><a name="Kinds-Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>The many advantages of descriptive pointing are crucial for a
scalable, generic pointing system. Descriptive pointing is
crucial for all the same reasons that descriptive markup is
crucial to documents, and that making links first-class objects
is crucial to linking. It is also clearly feasible, as shown by
multiple implementations of the prior WDs from the XML WG, and of
TEI extended pointers. At the same time, in order to get the
specification out in the time frame required, we wish to keep a
bound on the size of the language, and not implement all possible
constructs, tests, filters, and so on. XPointer thus seeks to
provide a small but rich set of descriptive pointing mechanisms,
such as walking around trees in terms of their fundamental
relationships; without taking on the undue task of a
full-fledged, multi-purpose tool to express every conceivable
predicate. To do more would take too long; to do less would
actually complicate and weaken applications, largely by limiting
XPointer to human-unclear, less robust, and less re-usable
pointers.</p>

<p>Some of the features of descriptive pointing bear some
similarity to querying in general, but that is because the term
&quot;querying&quot; covers an awful lot of ground: <a
href="#Yu98">Yu and Meng (1998)</a> note that &quot;the goal of
query processing and optimization is to find user-desired data
from an often very large database efficiently&quot; -- where
&quot;user-desired&quot; is arbitrarily broad; other definitions
speak of selecting data that &quot;fulfills arbitrary sets of
constraints&quot; or &quot;has certain characteristics&quot;.
These all cover a wide range of activities, whose requirements,
priorities, and consequent design tradeoffs differ greatly. A
search for an ID is a query (though a very simple one); and there
are many user and developer requests for XPointer features that
overlap with what one expects in a full-blown query language
(among the relevant issues already assigned numbers, are 17-21,
26, 27, 44, and 46-49). </p>

<p>This similarity is inevitable because <i>any</i> language that
selects things out of trees requires certain basic operations,
such as genetic access to nodes of the tree; without such
operations any language that deals with trees would be utterly
crippled. However, XPointer has other requirements that are not
shared by various other mechanisms that may arise for XML for
other purposes. Among these are robustness, plus a quite
different user perspective and priority: the purpose with
XPointer is to point to a known data object (typically a single
one or a well-defined group to be treated as if it were one),
rather than to discover whether any data might be out there
somewhere and how much.</p>

<p>By separating minimalist vs. descriptive pointing models and
acknowledging our need for both, we can assign our existing
XPointer issues more clearly into categories that we can deal
with effectively. This two-level approach allows a natural
beginning.</p>
