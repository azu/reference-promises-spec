<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (UAAG 1.0) provides guidelines for
    designing user agents (browsers) that lower barriers to Web accessibility for people
    with disabilities (visual, hearing, physical, cognitive, and neurological).</p>
<p>Since the release of UAAG 1.0 as a W3C Recommendation
    in December 2002, the UAWG has received feedback about the usability, understandability,
    and applicability of the suite of documents. Also, in the intervening years
there have been changes and improvements in </p>
<ul>
    <li>technologies and techniques used in web content,</li>
    <li> functionality of assistive technology,</li>
    <li> accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs), and</li>
    <li> platforms used to receive content. </li>
</ul>
<p>The feedback, changes, and information gathered from evaluating
    user agents using test suites to develop <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/impl-pr2/"> implementation
            reports</a>  is driving the development of
        UAAG 2.0 and is captured as the Requirements for UAAG 2.0 (this document).</p>
<p>The primary goal of UAAG 2.0 is the same as it was for version 1.0. To lower barriers to accessibility
of user agents.</p>
<p>We intend to ensure that the revision is backwards and forward compatible.</p>
<p>We intend to attract the participation of developers of browsers, assistive technologies, plug-ins, extensions, accessibility
    APIs (Microsoft Active Accessibility - MSAA, Gnome Accessibility Toolkit - ATK, iaccessible2, Microsoft UI Automation on Windows Vista - UIA, etc.) as well as consumers of
    accessibility APIs (e.g., some assistive technology and plug-in developers) and end users.</p>
<h2><a name="areas-for-dev" id="areas-for-dev"></a>Areas for Development in Version 2.0 </h2>
<h3><a name="ensuring-relevance" id="ensuring-relevance"></a>Ensure that UAAG 2.0 is relevant to evolving Web technologies:  </h3>
<p>In developing UAAG 2.0, the UAWG will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take into account advances in Web technologies since the release of UAAG 1.0. Specifically, the new version will add or improve references to W3C, non-W3C, compound documents, platforms, and emerging internet technologies. UAAG 2.0 will also promote the use of public engineered accessibility APIs and the implementation of Document Object Models (DOMs).
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>W3C technologies</strong> include HTML/XHTML, XFORMS, CSS, XSL, XSLT, MathML,
        SMIL, SVG, and others.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-W3C technologies</strong> include Flash, PDF, Shockwave, Java applets,
        video formats (QuickTime, REAL, Windows Media, etc.) and others.</li>
      <li><strong>Compound document examples</strong> include:
        <ul>
          <li> XHTML + SVG + MathML</li>
          <li> XHTML + SMIL</li>
          <li> XHTML + XForms</li>
          <li> XHTML + VoiceML</li>
          <li> Compound documents can also include integration
            of non-W3C formats with W3C or other non-W3C formats. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Platforms</strong> include both software and hardware frameworks, including
        architecture, operating systems and desktops, languages (scripting,
      programming, markup), and programming interfaces.
        <ul>
          <li>Primary operating systems and desktops include Windows XP and
            Vista, Linux (Gnome and KDE Desktops) and other UNIX variants such as Solaris,
            MacOS, and Java. Mobile platforms such as phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), etc.
            and their operating systems (PalmOS, Windows Mobile, Java ME,
          etc.) will also be considered. </li>
          <li>Scripting, programming, markup languages, and development
            environments include C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, XML User Interface Language (XUL), as
            well as W3C markup languages and many others. </li>
          <li>Programming interfaces include:
          <ul>
            <li> Native operating system programming interfaces
              for Windows, Linux, Java, MacOS, etc </li>
            <li> DOM programming interfaces such as COM interfaces
                  for Windows Internet Explorer and ISimpleDOMNode
              for Firefox</li>
            <li> Engineered accessibility APIs include Microsoft
                  Active Accessibility (MSAA) and IAccessible2 on Windows,
                  UI Automation on Windows Vista (UIA), Accessibility Toolkit
                  (ATK) and Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface
                  (AT-SPI) for Linux, and Universal Access for MacOS. </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Emerging technologies</strong> include W3C technologies such
        as XHTML, XForms, and Web APIs, as well as Rich Internet Applications
        (RIA) which include AJAX, mashups, wikis, widget toolkits like
        the Dojo toolkit, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Address the interaction of preferences that are set by
    various levels of technology (i.e., platform, browser, content) and
    by
    different actors (e.g., authors setting accesskeys and creating custom
    controls, browser-users setting keyboard preferences). The group will
    reference external preference negotiation protocols where they exist. </li>
  <li>Address the behavior of extensions and related technologies
    that allow the user to modify the view through scripting and other
    techniques such that these changes are made available to all appropriate
    accessibility mechanisms      (e.g., DOM, accessibility API, etc.).</li>
  <li>Address privacy of user settings. </li>
  <li>Consider adding search of conditional content. </li>
  <li>Address user agent repair functionality when content is non-conformant with
    WCAG 2.0. </li>
  <li>Address the balance between customizations complexity and streamlining
    (profiles).</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="ensuring-clarity" id="ensuring-clarity"></a>Ensure that the conformance requirements are clear</h3>
<p>In developing UAAG 2.0, the UAWG will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Consider modularizing the UAAG 2.0 document. One module would 
    address &quot;core&quot; browser capabilities (i.e., features for people
    needing 
    some accessibility support, but who do not use assistive technologies).
    Other modules might address voice browsers, speech input, etc. that,
    while important, are not as relevant to &quot;basic&quot; browsers. </li>
  <li>Be clear about which features/functions  can be passed off to assistive technologies
    and/or extensions.</li>
  <li>Ensure requirements are relevant on all platforms (techniques may be different). </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="identifying-benefits" id="identifying-benefits"></a>Identify clearly who benefits from accessible user agents.</h3>
<p>In developing UAAG 2.0, the UAWG will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Attempt, through informative support documents, to  more clearly
    identify who will benefit from each requirement.</li>
  <li>Attempt to address, as completely as possible, the needs of:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>user agent developers</li>
      <li>user agent extension developers</li>
      <li>user agent plug-in developers</li>
      <li>assistive technology developers</li>
      <li>API accessibility architects </li>
      <li>end users with:
        <ul>
          <li>blindness</li>
          <li>low vision</li>
          <li>color deficit or distortions</li>
          <li>deafness</li>
          <li>hearing loss</li>
          <li>cognitive limitations</li>
          <li>reading disabilities</li>
          <li>speech impairments</li>
          <li>paralysis, weakness, and other problems with movement
            and coordination of limbs</li>
          <li>photosensitivity</li>
          <li>and combinations thereof.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="modifying-design" id="modifying-design"></a>Modify the design of deliverables</h3>
<p>In developing UAAG 2.0, the UAWG will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Simplify the structure of the deliverables,
          where possible, in order to promote ease of use. In designing the usability of
          the deliverables, the UAWG will consult the results of the WAI Site
          Redesign Task Force usability testing and discuss the design with representatives
        of the WAI-EOWG.</li>
  <li>Make an effort to align the structure of the document, wherever appropriate, with the one used in ATAG 2.0 and
    WCAG 2.0 by splitting requirements into the perceivable, operable,
  understandable, and access system  interoperable categories.</li>
  <li>Examine whether similar checkpoints can be combined to reduce redundancy. </li>
</ol>
