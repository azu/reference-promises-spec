        This document explores a way of making privacy work better on the web, in a way that is 
        understandable to users and that imposes constraints as minimal as possible on authors
        and implementers.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy has been a hot topic in the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/'>Device APIs and Policy WG</a>
        due to the sensitive nature of the information that our work intends to expose. Notably, we discussed
        it rather extensively during the 
        <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2010Mar/0154.html'>first day of our March 2010 meeting in Prague</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approach we've decided to take is to break the problem down into smaller, hopefully more manageable
        pieces:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>How to define APIs in such a way that they are “naturally” privacy-friendly</dt>
        <dd>
          This is similar to writing APIs in such a way that they are security-friendly; you can't
          keep people from being stupid if they insist on it, but you can at least make it so that
          they can only be stupid on purpose. For instance, if you're designing an API to access the
          user's address book, don't just give blanket access to all the contacts database but rather
          make it so that only information that is strictly required for the requestor to operate is
          provided, and that the user gets to choose this information in an understandable manner.
        </dd>
        <dt>Only require from user-agents what, if anything, they can realistically enforce</dt>
        <dd>
          While sitting around a table in a committee meeting it is very easy to implement pretty much
          anything. You want ice cream from your browser? Trivial: “A <a>user-agent</a> MUST provide the
          user with ice cream upon request.” While it is disingenuous to pretend that browsers are not
          part of the solution to the privacy problem (they are, after all, <em>user</em> agents) it is
          all too easy to just dump the problem on them. And given how slow browser churn is, any 
          UA-based solution means a good decade will pass before the solution works.
        </dd>
        <dt>Education &amp; Outreach, similar to the accessibility efforts</dt>
        <dd>
          WAI and the Web community at large have done a great job raising awareness about accessibility
          issues, and while we certainly do not live in a perfect world their effort has had a very
          measurable impact. There is therefore experience to be tapped in such an approach for the parts
          of the problem that depend on convincing people to do the right thing (which in some cases can
          be wide-ranging such as making script libraries support the solution directly, or various organisations
          enforce it internally).
        </dd>
        <dt>A License Approach to Privacy</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This is the part that is explored in this document. During the F2F, I floated the idea that privacy
            could be (at least in part) treated as a licensing issue. When you get content from someone, you
            get it under a license; so when you give your data to someone, couldn't it be provided under
            similar terms?
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting from there, the next step is pretty obvious: could we have a simple, limited, easily
            explained vocabulary in a vein similar to <a href='http://creativecommons.org/'>Creative Commons</a>?
            What's great with throwing ideas against the wall early in the morning without knowing
            whether they might be good or if they are alcohol induced, is that one often finds out that
            <a href='http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/is-a-creative-commons-for-privacy-possible/'>other people 
            have had that idea before</a>. This is very reassuring because it entails that either you've
            had a good idea, which is cause for celebration, or you've found new drinking buddies.
            The devil is, of course, in the details.

      <h2>Licensing Information</h2>
      <p>
        There are <a href='http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/what-should-matter-in-privacy/'>many aspects</a> that 
        can be listed when it comes to what actions one may consider acceptable or not with given personal
        information. My goal is not to get into this discussion here; I will limit myself to noting that all
        proposals that I have seen so far still seem too complex to be comprehended.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of having concrete content to use in the examples below I devised a rather simple
        privacy licensing scheme intended primarily to be readable. Most notably I completely gloss over
        legal issues that vary across locales (e.g. in French law it's illegal not to make it possible for
        someone to update data concerning them). There are two actions that a service may
        take with one's data — retention and redistribution — and a modifier on both which is whether it will
        be in aggregate or not.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>retention</dt>
        <dd>
          Whether the service will keep your data around. This has three values: <strong>no</strong> (<code>nr</code>) which
          means that the data gets thrown away when your interaction session stops, <strong>short term</strong> 
          (<code>sr</code>) which means that the service keeps the data for a limited time, and <strong>permanent</strong>
          (<code>pr</code>) which means that it will never forget it (or perhaps only in specific cases, such
          as account deletion).
        </dd>
        <dt>redistribution</dt>
        <dd>
          A simple boolean (<code>red</code>) indicating whether the information may be provided to third-parties
          whoever they are. Cases in which a service is forced to redistribute information (being held-up at gunpoint,
          being forced by a legal search, etc.) do not count as redistribution.
        </dd>
        <dt>aggregate</dt>
        <dd>
          Describes cases in which data is used but only in an aggregate manner. Your information is there but it
          cannot be traced back to you. An <code>a</code> is added to either of the previous tokens.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        This yields a small set of simple codes. If you keep my data for three months, and show the anonymous countries
        from which your users come from on a publicly accessible map: <code>sr-reda</code>. If you want my name to
        generate anagrams but don't keep it: <code>nr</code>. If you're keeping my birthdate permanently but only
        using it to wish me a happy birthday: <code>pr</code>. If you're gathering my email address to sell it to
        spammers at every occasion: <code>pr-red</code>. If you're keeping a permanent, internal track of your users'
        first names: <code>pra</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Implementation Options</h2>
      <p>
        This section lists all the various implementations options that can be thought of. This is just
        a first draft containing the ideas that I can think of off the top of my head. It is not
        complete. I have deliberately not filtered out anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the solutions are service-initiated while some are user-initiated — it is not clear at this
        point where to best place the weight here. There may be room for more or less negotiated options, but
        those are likely to be more complex. Some options for how to handle this at the UI level are included
        as well.

        <section>
          <h2>Site policy in response headers</h2>
          <p>
            A site indicates its policy in its response headers, like P3P. For instance:
            <code>Privacy: pr-red</code>.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pros</dt>

            </dd>
            <dt>Cons</dt>
            <dd>
              Headers can be hard to configure for some users, and may not have the required
              granularity (e.g. two forms on the same page).
            </dd>
          </dl>

        <section>
          <h2>Just using images in content</h2>
          <p>
            Services simply add a set of well-known icons to their content, just like CC.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pros</dt>
            <dd>
              Simple, easily deployed, easily advocated. Can be extended to mitigate the cons.

            <dd>

          <h2>A <code>rel</code> value</h2>
          <p>
            A new <code>rel</code> value of "privacy" is introduced:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_html'>&lt;link rel='privacy' href='http://w3.org/plic/sr-reda'/>
&lt;a rel='privacy' href='http://w3.org/plic/sr-reda'>&lt;img .../>&lt;/a></pre>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pros</dt>
            <dd>
              Can provide multiple levels of granularity (document, or if contained in a form applies just to that);
              works well with snippets that can be pasted.

          <p>
            An HTTP header is sent with ever HTTP request indicating the user's stated privacy preferences,
            e.g. <code>Accept-Privacy: sr-reda</code>. Such preferences are presumably configured in the UA.
            Services must either comply, or refuse the request.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pros</dt>
            <dd>
              None that I can think of.

            <dt>Cons</dt>
            <dd>
              Bloats headers; leaves no room for negotiation; will lead users to blanket approve everything;
              won't work.

            The browser acquires the privacy licensing metadata and displays it in the chrome.

            <dd>
              The chrome is already crammed full of stuff. Unlike the other big trust icon for SSL, this
              is not information that the browser can verify and it is dangerous to give the impression 
              that it is.

          <h2>Non-modal content-invasive indications</h2>
          <p>
            The browser acquires the privacy licensing metadata and displays it contextually with the
            interaction that the user is making. For instance, if the user is filling out a form, the browser
            provides an indication of whether it matches the user's intended preference. In that case,
            a large, red tooltip could appear next to the field that the user is filling out stating
            “This service does not comply with your preferred privacy.” By being in the content it is
            very user-visible, but does not have chrome-level “trust”; since it is non-modal it doesn't
            get killed.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pros</dt>
            <dd>
              Makes the information very available, but without the trust issues implied in chrome.
