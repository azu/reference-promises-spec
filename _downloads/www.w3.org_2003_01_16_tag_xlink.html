<p>This meeting was organized as part of discussion of TAG issue <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#xlinkScope-23">xlinkScope-23</a>: What
is the scope of using XLink?</p>

<h2>Minutes</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">PG</span>: We should ask ourselves whether links are primitive things or
      less primitive (like style). Depending on whether links are
      "style-ish", then I think it makes sense to have a language that
      applies link-ness. If not, then it makes more sense to have links
      hardwired (i.e., in namespace)</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">T&Ccedil;</span>: I think there's a little of both...both presentation and
      fundamental semantics in linking. Some semantics may also depend on the
      language instance.</dd>
    <dd><em>[TB agrees with T&Ccedil;]</em></dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: I'd probably be uncomfortable with moving linking info to
      external resources (i.e., not right inline)</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: Linking semantics is attributed, not intrinsic. Linking is
      low-level, but attributed and at user option. Close parallel to
      "id-ness" and binding to the letters "I-D".</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>hmm... &lt;img src= is by default on, although in principle at user
      option</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: I think that some form of explicit signal is required that
      something is a link. A lightweight signal is important. I have a
      serious allergy to yet-another-little-language. Whether hidden in a
      process inst. or in another doc. Let's use existing languages.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Liam, you wanted to suggest 3 kinds of link, and we don't need to
      solve all 3</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ</span>: definitions 
      <ol>
        <li>Two or more resources are linked if there's a relationship
          between (among) them.</li>
        <li>A "displayed link" is a rendered link.</li>
        <li>A "markup link" is a way of representing a link in markup
          (whether explicit or deduced).</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ</span>: We don't have to solve all possible ways of deducing links.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">Micah</span>: XForms philosophy regarding author's intent; important to
      capture intent in markup. Details like "has to happen on load" is more
      related to presentation.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">T&Ccedil;</span>: If something is likely to require
changes for different devices, media,
      or users, that is likely to be presentational and should be considered
      separate from "content".</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>what Tantek said</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>Concept: if something is likely to require changes for different
      devices, different media, or different users due to disabilities, that
      something is very likely presentational, and should remain separate and
      distinct from the markup of content.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TimBL, you wanted to suggest a tire hanging from the branch</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: We need to have a simple solution for authors (e.g., authors
      used to HTML). There needs to be a very simple core. No levels of
      indirection unless we need them.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">BP</span>: On content v. presentation - In the voice dialog, the active
      linking is not exposed to the user at all from a presentation
      standpoint. The fact that the user may link between two locations is
      transparent to the user. There are other ways to associate resources;
      does linking include all mechanisms?</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>browsing isn't the only application, and follow-me isn't the only
      semantics</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TBray, you wanted to ask for briefing on state of discussion in HTML
      WG and which direction they think HTML ought to go (after this
    thread)</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: HTML WG has a special status, IMO, since HTML so widely
    deployed.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: XHTML 2.0 has basically two attributes: (1) href-style and (2)
      embedding. The way the xhtml family is designed, another module could
      come along and want to add its own linking attributes.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: Do you see urgently needed addition to linking semantics from
      xhtml 1.*?</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: Fine for the present.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">SW</span>: Relaxed backwards compatibility constraints and impact on this
      context?</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: Our objections to using XLink were not related to backwards
      compatibility.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: The backwards compatibility issue is multiple attributes that
      relate to linking. Hard to deprecate due to current deployment. We have
      deprecated esoteric features. Primary structural challenge to bringing
      XLink into XHTML 2.0 is multiple linking attributes.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TimBL, you wanted to say that from my personal point of view, this
      meeting needs to resolve linking from the user experience.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: I consider this meeting to be focused on links that are in and
      out of user experience. I'm less interested here in general
      relationships between resources; out of scope.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">NW</span>: I agree with TBL on scope here: user experience.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Ht, you wanted to say that making easy things easy is fine but hard
      things have to be possible</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: Outline of a partial solution: (a) Simple things should be simple
      and should stay as simple as <code>html:a</code>. (b) I have no problem
      with a design that grandfathers in a bare-minimum syntax to allow old
      syntax. I think not simple if each WG redefines attribs in local
      namespace with same name and semantics. Some grandfathering is good.
      XLink should have predefined a linking element. I don't want to see the
      multi-ended solution, for links with more complexity, to be completely
      divorced from that story. At the end of the day, we may agree that new
      infoset properties are the right way to merge the stories we need to
      accommodate.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: Another xlink change suggestion: infer xlink type attribute to
      reduce verbosity.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>HT endorses TB's suggestion</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: On the question of multiple attributes with linking semantics -
      there are some strong motivators for using elements instead when
      multiple links required.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">MD</span>: Some complex stuff may not need standardization.</dd>
    <dd>See <a
      href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Oct/0073.html">Tim
      Bray email on inference of xlink:type.</a></dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>IMHO User experience aspect includes two things: ease or authoring /
      usability, and presentation. Current generic solutions are poor
at both. In terms of ease of authoring, the syntactic vinegar and markupJunk
      problem has already been documented.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>I agree that committing to supporting multiple attribute-based links
      on one element is a corner case that should not be allowed to drive the
      solution</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>In terms of presentation, taking in mind my above straw concept
      about separation of presentation and markup, the current generic
      solution fails very badly by mixing in linking presentation and linking
      semantics. The show and actuate attributes being the prime
    offenders.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Steven, you wanted to address attribute/element question</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span> regarding element approach to multiple links: We should have
      solutions that suit various people's style of markup.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: Perhaps we can have a simple xlink attribute, or to provide
      guidance on what to do when there are multiple attribs on same element
      that have linking semantics. Not sure that always having multiple link
      attribs always a problem.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Ht, you wanted to disagree about multiple flowers</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: Design should not try to be all things to all people.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>Not necessarily, but should attempt</dd>
  <dt>[mdubinko]</dt>
    <dd>&lt;image src="some URI" href="some URI"/&gt;</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: Corner case of multiple attributes with link semantics on same
      element should not drive design.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: I didn't suggest that it should.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: But it may.</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>Just for the record: I am prepared to argue that multiple-attribute
      inevitably brings up serious design problems</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">NW</span>: I think 1000-flowers approach not best here. I think there are
      some simple linking semantics that are well-entrenched in the Web. I'd
      rather see a simple core that will work for the most common use
    cases.</dd>
  <dt>[mdubinko]</dt>
    <dd>Ian, Norm was referring to my earlier comments: 'simple core applies
      horizontally, app-specific markup for vertical bits'</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>Designing around half the world's needs will guarantee problems</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SW</span>: If we ask another group to do more work in this space, what would
      we be asking them to address?</dd>
    <dd><em>TB notes that XLink WG has closed.</em></dd>
  <dt>[jax]</dt>
    <dd>Adding to the multiple link scenario; HTML 4 example with longdesc
      and src</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>jax, I think the src/longdesc design is a real problem, starting with
      i18n issues</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: The choice of group that you ask to do this work will greatly
      affect the work.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>HTML WG is chartered to do it</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">T&Ccedil;</span>: Value to pursuing more than one solution at the same time. Each
      solution can benefit from improvements of other approaches. Foolish to
      pursue just one solution that tries to satisfy all constraints.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TimBL, you wanted to suggest HTML and SVG and Math are all
    relevant.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: What ought to happen - solve the mixed namespaces problem. The
      solution needs to target more than, say, just XHTML.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>HTML WG would be happy with <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2000/css3/clink-nov-6.html">CLink</a>/CSS-style solution</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>IMHO a key portion of solving the mixed namespaces problem is solving
      the syntactic vinegar / markupJunk problem that comes along with
      namespaces. And I agree that the mixed namespaces problem needs to be
      solved.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">MD</span>: Yes to multiple namespace docs (cf Xforms). The new wave of
      modular XML vocabs will constrain the way that you can design a linking
      language. Need to take into account unforeseen combinations (including
      two linking attribs on same element).</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Liam, you wanted to agree with Tim, this is the way XML on the web
      must go</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ, TB</span>: Yes to multiple namespace concern.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: That suggests that there's a good argument for the existence of
      an xlink-like option.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>Straw proposal: Simple embed vs. hyperlink distinction as schema
      datatypes.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: Sounds like an xlink approach that removes some presentation
      things would be a big win.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Ht, you wanted to say that XML Schema easily provides the resource
      (type definitions) to allow a wide range of languages to share a
      linking syntax and/or semantics</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>No one has argued against a linking vocab to avoid having to design
      your own, I think</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: Mechanism of type definition provided by XML Schema gives a way
      for many languages to share a resource without committing to what the
      names of the elements or even attributes have to be.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: People don't all have to schema-validate!</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: Infoset is the place for shared linking semantics. Schema is
      the place for shared linking syntax.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TimBL, you wanted to probe a bit where this attribute-oriented
      approach is driven by. Mixing attributes is inherently messy in XML,
      while element nesting is not. Therefore a linking language fro example
      should provide elements rather than attributes. Why not?</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: Is the issue with element approach verbosity?</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>infoset is a way of tying _recs_ together</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Liam, you wanted to speak on elements vs attributes</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ</span>  on attributes: Philosophical difference depending on how one
      perceives the link.</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>What I said: infoset is nice but syntax is essential</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>I think Liam has misunderstood Tim's point -- not that you shouldn't
      use attributes for links, but that to compose links you have to nest
      their signalling elements, not merge them</dd>
  <dt>[mdubinko]</dt>
    <dd>Using 'href' or 'someprefix:href' for EVERY kind of link particularly
      causes problems in combining languages</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ</span>: Verbosity is important, backwards compatibility important. But
      philosophy is important. Neither xml nor namespaces clear about mixing
      same attributes on element.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">NW</span>: Problem with infoset solution is that there's no common markup
      idiom for users. Not a complete solution if each language chooses
      different syntax.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>Sacrificing usability for syntactic universality is also bad.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: Simplicity for authors important. One attribute can be simpler
      than nested elements. e.g., deployment of smil may have been easier due
      to attribute focus.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Steven, you wanted to talk about content models</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span> on element v attribute approach: I understand motivation for both
      approaches. W3C should not say "This is the only way to design
    XML."</dd>
  <dt>[PGrosso]</dt>
    <dd>But "allowing different ways to design XML" depends on whether you
      think this is a basic thing like xinclude or a variable thing like
      style.</dd>
    <dd>If linking is basic to the Web, then allowing alternate designs may
      not be the best way to go.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: Consider P3P. You can't define a P3P policy for an XML document
      today. If we design a language where an element is only allowed to have
      one attribute that has a URI value, we might cut off the possibility of
      extending XML to add P3P policies. Summary - easier to add attributes
      than to add elements.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: See CL and MW comments on problems in doing multiple end links
      using attribute syntax. I've not seen responses to those posting. View
      source metric important for hyperlinking</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TimBL, you wanted to point out that that adding that attribute was
      not a link.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: We are looking here for a way to include a user-accessible
    link.</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>I said that I think you can do an element-based syntax for
      multi-ended links that avoids the "longdesc" problems and is still
      perfectly comprehensible by ordinary people</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: I think P3P/XML example out of scope; there are lots of things
      that have URIs.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">T&Ccedil;</span>: Are attribute args discussed here more hypothetical than
      practical?</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: I think real problems.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>e.g. &lt;img href="http://gohere.example.org/" src="http://embedthis.example.org/" /&gt; seems to work
      fine.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: At the end of the day we want to enrich hyperlinks. If you have
      attribute-based hyperlinks, you have attribs about attributes. That is
      hairy. Internationalization is another example; when you want to have
      more than one instance of something, you should do through elements.

  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Ht, you wanted to say there's a difference between this-is-an-URL and
      this-is-a-link</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: At the heart of this issue is acknowledging distinction between
      "this is a URI" and "this is a link". Being a URI is not all there is
      to being a link. We'd probably agree that xlink went too far by
      including presentation info. Can we reach agreement that one needs to
      know more than a URI to know about a hyperlink?</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">T&Ccedil;</span>: Allow multiple solutions to proceed ("1000 flowers"). On tech
      args against multiple attributes - most of these arguments seem to
      depend on assumption of an ONLY-ATTRIBUTE solution.</dd>

  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: We could initiate an effort to design a subset that meets needs

    <dd>Using multiple attributes for linking does NOT preclude using
      multiple elements for links.</dd>
    <dd>Allow multiple attributes for simpler cases, and encourage multiple
      elements for more complex cases, e.g. links to 20 different natural
      language versions of a document.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: Could allow authors to be attributionists and format designers to
      be elementists.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>HTML does this today, with various linking attributes and with the
      &lt;link&gt; element.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: I think a mapping between the two would meet the needs of HTML
      WG. Add a layer that does mapping from elements to attributes.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span> proposal: 
      <ol>
        <li>Seems to be agreement that mixed namespace docs are a problem we
          have to face. Common vocab a good goal.</li>
        <li>Reduce XLink, with more derivation of attributes; radical removal
          of presentation/behavior. Would that meet lots of requirements?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="spk">TB</span>: Who would do this work?</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: I think that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hlink/">HLink</a> and <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2000/css3/clink-nov-6.html">CLink</a> would be good solutions as well.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>ht agrees with Tim Bray's proposal</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: TB's design not perfect since doesn't fulfill design goal of not
      requiring changes to instances (see <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-xlink-req/#syntax">XLink Requirement
      B.2</a>). You should be able to infer links without having to put the
      links in the document.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">BP</span>: It's important to specify and evangelize importance of link
      metadata .</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>there is an integrity issue wrt inline vs. offboard signalling of
      linkness</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>problem with CLink is that it's external-only (right?) makes life
      harder for spiders</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TimBL, you wanted to add another requirement - that you should be
      able to infer links with only the document available. Also, you wanted
      to note that there is a separate meeting to have about embedded
      metatdata in HTML etc</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: Should be able to infer links with only the document available.
      That complements SP's requirement.</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>TBL wants potential for 100% self-descriptive links with no call-out
      to another resource</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>this is the View Source argument again</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><em>[TBL recaps view source benefits]</em></dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: I'm in favor of fewer indirections to find out something is a
      link. Attempt to meet the requirement of multiple links has been done
      through generalization. A new xlink should have a (1) simple syntax
      that should be extensible; element-based (2) backwards compatible to
      HTML stuff bolted on; don't need to do for other content than HTML.</dd>
      <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: You can't do view source easily for presentation stuff. Shouldn't
      be a requirement for every piece of information you do in XML. A
      layered solution will give you view source possibility.</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>Presentation is not semantics.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>And semantics should not require a particular presentation.</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>Yep</dd>
  <dt>[mdubinko]</dt>
    <dd>the single main document should express intent, any related resources
      ought to be supplemental</dd>
  <dt>[TimBL]</dt>
    <dd>To clarify - I was not ruling out style sheets..... for style</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Liam, you wanted to urge static semantics ala tim but point out the
      style sheets can already impute linkness</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ</span>: I agree with TBL on view source value.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>I think it is important not only to tell whether "it is a link", but
      whether it is a "hyperlink reference" or an "embed". I'm not sure that
      other distinctions are necessary from the view source perspective.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>But I was saying: the show source argument doesn't hold for styling,
      so why is show source so important?</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>steven: because style is less implicated in document function than
      linking is, by a significant amount</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>Another way to think of it is the "deep copy" example: when
      performing a deep copy of a compound document, you need to know which
      elements to copy with a document, and which not to. This corresponds
      1:1 to the embed/hyperlink distinction.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ</span>: Multiple vocabs should be able to share static semantics. We
      should not rule out style sheet-type mechanism to impute linking
      semantics. There's a descriptive value of schemas here; mapping into
      xlink. Need to make sure that xlink ends up being power enough to be
      mapped into.</dd>
  <dt>[TimBL]</dt>
    <dd>re: "But I was saying: the show source argument doesn't hold for
      styling, so why is show source so important?" I think that the
      community has a fairly well defined concept of separation of form and
      content.</dd>
  <dt>[Liam]</dt>
    <dd>agreed with separation, understanding of that is growing fast</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>there are no absolutes: separation of form/content brings enough
      benefits so as to justify lossage on "view source" front</dd>
    <dd>but i'm not sure that's true for linkage</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>ht agrees</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><em>Scribe uncertain, but thinks he talked here about analogy with
      style sheets in HTML: several mechanisms have proved useful for
      different scenarios. Scribe (and HT) believe this point was made by
      Michael Sperberg-McQueen.</em></dd>
  <dt>[PGrosso]</dt>
    <dd>Per what Ian is saying, but that depends on whether linking is basic
      like xinclude or more like style.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">IJ</span>: What is drawback to allowing both element and attribute approach?
      Do we have documented drawbacks for style flexibility in HTML?</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">PG</span>: Gets back to my point about whether linking more like style.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: I like CLink (elegant) but nervous that will make life harder for
      robots, spiders.</dd>
  <dt>[mdubinko]</dt>
    <dd>a trend towards fewer is better, but not an absolute 'MUST BE ONLY
      ONE' requirement</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><em>LR clarifies use of CSS-like approach of external assignment of
      semantics.</em></dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>There's no way to make there only be one, but there could be one that
      we agree to use for some kinds of linking.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: What's the document for in the case where link semantics applied
      externally?</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>the Web brought a new thing into the world: the notion that content
      should contain embedded actionable pointers to other content. You don't
      hae that it's not the web any more</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>What TBray said.</dd>
  <dt>[jax]</dt>
    <dd>It isn't to add the semantics link sheet is useful</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>agree with Lloyd</dd>
  <dt>[jax]</dt>
    <dd>It is for the user to handle what links to interact with, and how</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: External sheets allow later application of link semantics without
      changing content. I think there are situations where people will want
      to be able to do external application of semantics.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>Why isn't Schema already sufficient for that goal?</dd>
  <dt>[jax]</dt>
    <dd>There *is* a possible downside to link styling in that you could use
      link styling in a way that is unobvious</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">LQ</span>: I agree with LR's comments. We also have to bear in mind that
      when we designed XML we had lots of experience with documents, less
      with data. More research should be done on linking...I'm uneasy with
      PG's proposal to have one way...we may need more. Extended XML Schema
      better than link sheet.</dd>
  <dt>[jax]</dt>
    <dd>that is the same argument as with XML everyone will make their own
      tags, and interoperability is out the door. Didn't happen, won't
    happen.</dd>
  <dt>[Lloyd]</dt>
    <dd>Agree with Liam, but we do want one way to define underlying
      *semantics*</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">IJ</span> summarizing a proposal: allow element and attribute approach,
      highlight caveats of each approach; forget link sheets for now.</dd>
  <dt>[Liam]</dt>
    <dd>hearhear, Ian.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>HLink _is_ a link sheet proposal, you can't argue against link sheets
      and for HLink</dd>
  <dt>[PGrosso]</dt>
    <dd>Right, what HT just said.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">IJ</span>: I think that the multiple ways of specifying style in HTML show
      that multiple approaches can be valuable.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: I like TB's proposal better than IJ's - I don't think IJ's
      analogy to style works.</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>Reminder of part (b) of earlier proposal: Reduce XLink, with more
      derivation of attributes; radical removal of presentation/behavior.
      Would that meet lots of requirements?</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>add built-in element</dd>
  <dt>[TimBL]</dt>
    <dd>If you can do it with one method that is a lot better than doing it
      with three.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>I don't accept that requirement (don't modify the instance)</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">IJ</span>: The objection to TB's approach was you can't avoid modifying the
      instance.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>I prefer Ian Jacob's proposal as a starting point. I think he
      captured more of what is needed.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SP</span>: Current de facto solutions (1) CLink-like [Opera], (2) XBL
      [Mozilla], (3) Behaviors [IE]. Advantage to link sheet approach is that
      you don't need to build more knowledge into browser.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: I like TB's proposal. Please add "html:a" to xlink in TB's proposal.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>I don't think that that helps</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">TimBL, you wanted to ask - Does TB's solution allow one to make a
      link:a anchor elements in the xlink namespace</dd>
  <dt>[TimBL]</dt>
    <dd>TB: I wouldn't want to define things at such a high level of detail
      at this stage.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">NW</span>: My objection to the CLink/HLink approaches - I want links to be
      first class things. As chair of Docbook TC, we've been waiting for
      years to adopt an XLink solution. I'd like the solution to not require
      an external mechanism for identifying links.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>Sounds like a clear lack of consensus here</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>Lloyd: I don't care if the style is totally lost, I want the link to
      persist.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>I don't see how they are different. If you have a clink style, you
      can use it to define an xlink: style. End of story</dd>
  <dt>[Lloyd]</dt>
    <dd>Norm: Point is style is maintained and dependable. So can links.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: Please poll folks to find out priority of internal v. external
      link info.</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>No, style is not maintained and dependable. And I don't care if style
      is lost. But I don't want links to be lost, or confused, or
    changed.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: Summarizing - links self-describing in the instance or preference
      for link sheets?</dd>
    <dd>Internal: TBL, SW, PG, NW, TB, HT</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>Allow Internal but NOT require.</dd>
  <dt>[jax]</dt>
    <dd>second that</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">IJ</span>: Question is PREFERENCE for internal or external (I think)</dd>
    <dd><em>[Poll killed]</em></dd>
    <dd>T&Ccedil;: I think solution of internal link markup is fine, but don't
      exclude other approaches.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>Strongly disagree</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">JAX</span>: It's fine to have linking mechanism embedded. What HLink will
      add is the ability to say later something that the format didn't or
      couldn't say. The ability of styling linking doesn't mean you shouldn't
      be able to specify things int he markup.</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>Some authors (and language designers) wish to keep as much of the
      "markupJunk" out of document content as possible. This is a real
    need.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Liam, you wanted to claim mixing namespaces is a higher issue</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>That's not the way I read HLink -- without the link sheet there is
      _no way_ to tell what elements are links</dd>
    <dd>please can we talk about who does this?</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>Liam: I don't believe I was conflating the two issues</dd>
  <dt>[Liam]</dt>
    <dd>Norm, ok, sorry</dd>
  <dt>[Tantek]</dt>
    <dd>ht: that's why Steven has said in the past that HLink and XLink are
      not different solutions, but part of one solution. (sorry if I
      misquoted you Steven).</dd>
  <dt>[Lloyd]</dt>
    <dd>also thinks this has been useful.</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TB</span>: Let's figure out what work we can do to move forward.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">LR</span>: Let HLink go forward with certain requirements or guidelines.</dd>
  <dt>[PGrosso]</dt>
    <dd>If we don't decide whether linkness is first class or more like
      style, then I don't think we've moved forward.</dd>
  <dt>[ht]</dt>
    <dd>I am not happy with that proposal</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>Yeah, what PGrosso said, I think.</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>mark me -1 on that</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>I had been told that XML2002 had moved the discussion forward (I
      wasn't there)</dd>
  <dt>[mdubinko]</dt>
    <dd>links are first-class, link syntax is not (cf historical 'href'
      attribute)</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: Is the HTML WG happy to use a link namespace on things that are
      links.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>It is not just about HTML. Also SYMM, XForms. It is about a general
      solution</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>steven: the XML2002 discussion was lively, but I don't feel at the
      end of the day that we moved very far. Alas, I was chairing and unable
      to take minutes.</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>Others told me that there was a feeling of generating consensus</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>steven: I fear I failed to detect what that consensus was. Perhaps I
      missed it</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>OK Norm</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd>[<span class="spk">IJ</span>: I think HTML WG has said that namespace prefix not a major
      problem.]</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>Not a problem per se. HTML WG is not against namespaces</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">TBL</span>: Most important is to ensure that simple solution exists.</dd>
    <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: The venue for taking this forward?</dd>
  <dt>[TimBL]</dt>
    <dd>It is always easier to take a simple thing and add complexity than to
      do the reverse.</dd>
  <dt>[TBray]</dt>
    <dd>and isolating areas of disagreement is useful!</dd>
  <dt>[steven]</dt>
    <dd>And I think that those areas are the source of the problem</dd>
  <dt>[Norm]</dt>
    <dd>steven: on reflection, it was probably a failure on my part to do a
      good wrap-up at xml 2002 and write down the consensus opinions.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Liam, you wanted to affirm tf</dd>
    <dd>TBray, you wanted to say we have successfully isolated areas of
      technical disagreement (1) linkage in-doc vs external, (2) desirability
      of multi-attribute links</dd>
  <dt>[Ian]</dt>
    <dd><span class="spk">SW</span>: Where should followup discussion take place?</dd>
      <dd>Proposed www-tag: +1 from HT, TB, MD</dd>
      <dd>Proposed BOF during week of technical plenary: TB, HT, T&Ccedil;, BP, JAX,
      NW</dd>
      <dd><span class="spk">HT</span>: But during the Wednesday plenary is a bad idea.</dd>
  <dt>[Zakim]</dt>
    <dd class="zakim">Tantek, you wanted to say why only one "venue"? Why not let multiple
      solutions move forward for the moment at least?</dd>
