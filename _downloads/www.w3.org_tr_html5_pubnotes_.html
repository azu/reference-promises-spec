    <p>This section provides a high-level list of selected changes
      made to the HTML 5 draft specification after 22 January
      2008. For more detailed descriptions of the changes,
      see the sections in this document that follow this one.
      (Note: The source for this summary is maintained in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/">HTML 5
        differences from HTML 4</a> document <a href="#html4diffs">[HTML4DIFFS]</a>; the summary was
      copied from that document into this one.)</p>
    
    <ul>
     <li>Implementation and authoring details around the <code>ping</code>
     attribute have changed.
     </li><li><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=content-type&gt;</code> is now a
     conforming way to set the character encoding.</li>
     <li>API for the <code>canvas</code> element has been cleaned up. Text
     support has been added.
     </li><li><code>globalStorage</code> is now restricted to the same-origin
     policy and renamed to <code>localStorage</code>. Related event
     dispatching has been clarified.
     </li><li><code>postMessage()</code> API changed. Only the origin of the
     message is exposed, no longer the URI. It also requires a second
     argument that indicates the origin of the target document.
     </li><li>Drag and drop API has got clarification. The
     <code>dataTransfer</code> object now has a <code>types</code>
     attribute indicating the type of data being transferred.
     </li><li>The <code>m</code> element is now called <code>mark</code>.
     </li><li>Server-sent events has changed and gotten clarification. It uses a
     new format so that older implementations are not broken.
     </li><li>The <code>figure</code> element no longer requires a caption.
     </li><li>The <code>ol</code> element has a new <code>reversed</code>
     attribute.
     </li><li>Character encoding detection has changed in response to feedback.
     </li><li>Various changes have been made to the HTML parser section in
     response to implementation feedback.
     </li><li>Various changes to the editing section have been made, including
     adding <code>queryCommandEnabled()</code> and related methods.
     </li><li>The <code>headers</code> attribute has been added for
     <code>td</code> elements.
     </li><li>The <code>table</code> element has a new <code>createTBody()</code>
     method.
     </li><li>MathML support has been added to the HTML parser section. (SVG
     support is still awaiting input from the SVG WG.)
     </li><li>Author defined attributes have been added. Authors can add
     attributes to elements in the form of
     <code>data-<var>name</var></code> and can access these through the DOM
     using <code>dataset[<var>name</var>]</code> on the element in question.
     </li><li>The <code>q</code> element has changed to require punctation inside
     rather than having the browser render it.
     </li><li>The <code>target</code> attribute can now have the value
     <code>_blank</code>.
     </li><li>The <code>showModalDialog</code> API has been added.
     </li><li>The <code>document.domain</code> API has been defined.
     </li><li>The <code>source</code> element now has a new
     <code>pixelratio</code> attribute useful for videos that have some kind
     encoding error.
     </li><li><code>bufferedBytes</code>, <code>totalBytes</code> and
     <code>bufferingThrottled</code> DOM attributes have been added to the
     <code>video</code> element.
     </li><li>Media <code>begin</code> event has been renamed to
     <code>loadstart</code> for consistency with the Progress Events
     specification.
     </li><li><code>charset</code> attribute has been added to
     <code>script</code>.
     </li><li>The <code>iframe</code> element has gained the <code>sandbox</code>
     and <code>seamless</code> attributes which provide sandboxing
     functionality.
     </li><li>The <code>ruby</code>, <code>rt</code> and <code>rp</code>
     elements have been added to support ruby annotation.
     </li><li>A <code>showNotification()</code> method has been added to show

        <p>This section provides a per-section record of changes
        in the 10 June 2008 working draft of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080610/">HTML 5
        specification</a> <a href="#html5">[HTML5]</a>
        that were made after the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/">22
          January 2008 First Public Working Draft (FPWD)</a> <a href="#html5fpwd">[HTML5FPWD]</a>. Note that it
        documents substantive changes only, and omits editorial
        changes. It is intended to be readable as a “standalone”
        document — meaning that readers are meant to be able to
        use it to get an overview of the changes that have been
        made, without necessarily needing to read the
        specification itself or to read through the entire diff

          2008.</p></div>
          <p>This section
          provides information about conformance requirements
          for Web browsers and user agents, conformance
          checkers, data mining tools, authoring tools, and
          markup generators. In this section, the following
          changes were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the introduction for this section, the words
            “SHALL” and “SHALL NOT” were <strong>removed</strong>
            from the list of words that “are to be interpreted as
            described in
            RFC2119”.</li>
            <li>In the “Conformance checkers” subsection, the text
            of a statement was updated to now read (added text
            highlighted):
            <blockquote>
              <p><q><em class="highlight">Automated</em>
                conformance checkers are exempt from detecting
                errors that require interpretation of the author’s
                intent (for example, while a document is
                non-conforming if the content of a blockquote
                element is not a quote, conformance checkers
                <em class="highlight">running without the input of
                  human judgement</em> do not have to check that
                blockquote elements only contain quoted
                material).</q></p>
            </blockquote>
            Also, the text of a related statement was updated to
            reference the concept of the <strong>browsing
              context</strong>; the text of that statement now
            reads:
            <blockquote>
              <p><q>Conformance checkers must check that
                the input document conforms when parsed without a
                browsing context (meaning that no scripts are run,
                and that the parser’s scripting flag is disabled),
                and should also check that the input document
                conforms when parsed with a browsing context in
                which scripts execute, and that the scripts never
                cause non-conforming states to occur other than
                transiently during script execution
                itself.</q></p>
            </blockquote></li>
            <li>In the “Common conformance requirements for APIs
            exposed to JavaScript” subsection, for consistency
            with the Web IDL specification <a href="#webidl">[WebIDL]</a>, statements related
            to cases for throwing NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR and
            TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR exceptions were removed.</li>
            <li>In a note that concerns XML processors, the
            following statement was <strong>removed</strong>
            completely: <q>For interoperability, authors are
              advised to avoid optional features of XML.</q></li>
            <li>In the “Dependencies” subsection, a note was
            emended to now read (added text highlighted), <q>It is
              possible for xml:base attributes to be present even
              in HTML fragments, as such attributes can be added
              dynamically using script. <em class="highlight">(Such
                scripts would not be conforming, however, as
                xml:base attributes as not allowed in HTML

          <p>This section
          provides information about specific technical terms used
          in the specification. In this section, the following
          changes were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A paragraph regarding usage of IDL in the
            specification was shortened and refined to read:
            <q>DOM interfaces defined in this specification use
              Web IDL. User agents must implement these interfaces
              as defined by the Web IDL specification.</q></li>
            <li>The following text related to the term “plugin”
            was added (with parts of it being moved here from the
            section for the
            <code class="element">embed</code>
            element):
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>The term plugin is used to mean any content
                  handler, typically a third-party content handler,
                  for Web content types that are not supported by
                  the user agent natively, or for content types that
                  do not expose a DOM, that supports rendering the
                  content as part of the user agent’s
                  interface.</q></p>

                <p><q>One example of a plugin would be a PDF viewer that
                  is instantiated in a browsing context when the
                  user navigates to a PDF file. This would count as
                  a plugin regardless of whether the party that
                  implemented the PDF viewer component was the same
                  as that which implemented the user agent itself.
                  However, a PDF viewer application that launches
                  separate from the user agent (as opposed to using
                  the same interface) is not a plugin by this
                  definition.</q></p>

                <p><q>Note: This specification does not define a
                  mechanism for interacting with plugins, as it is
                  expected to be user-agent- and platform-specific.
                  Some UAs might opt to support a plugin mechanism
                  such as the Netscape Plugin API; others might use
                  remote content converters or have built-in support
                  for certain types.</q></p>

                <p><q>Warning! Browsers should take extreme care when
                  interacting with external content intended for
                  plugins. When third-party software is run with the
                  same privileges as the user agent itself,
                  vulnerabilities in the third-party software become
                  as dangerous as those in the user agent.</q></p>

          <p>This section defines the
          Document object. In this section, the following changes
          were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The following attributes were added to the
            definition of the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface:
              <ul>
                <li><code class="domattribute">charset</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">characterSet</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">defaultCharset</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">embeds</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">plugins</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">readyState</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">scripts</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">queryCommandEnabled</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">queryCommandIndeterm</code></li>
                <li><code class="domattribute">queryCommandState</code></li>

                <li><code class="domattribute">queryCommandValue</code></li>
              </ul>
              The interface was also updated for consistency with
              the Web IDL specification <a href="#webidl">[WebIDL]</a>, and to correctly document
              the <code class="method">hasFocus()</code> method as a
              method (previously, the interface definition had
              incorrectly indicated that it was an
              attribute).</li>
            <li>In the “Resource metadata management” subsection,
            content that related to the <code class="domattribute">domain</code> DOM attribute
            (which is “used to enable pages on different hosts of
            a domain to access each others’ DOMs”) was moved out
            to form the basis for the algorithm in the “Relaxing
            the same-origin restriction” in the “Origin” section.</li>
            <li>Also in the “Resource metadata management”
            subsection, conformance criteria for data returned by
            the <code class="domattribute">referrer</code> DOM
            attribute and other parts of the section was refined —
            in particular, to reference
            the concepts of the <strong>active document</strong>
            and <strong>source browsing context</strong> —
            and the following note was
            added: <q>Typically user agents are configured to not
              report referrers in the case where the referrer uses
              an encrypted protocol and the current page does not
              (e.g. when navigating from an https: page to an
              http: page).</q> In the latter part of that same
            subsection, additional language was added that relates to:
              <ul>
                <li>quirks mode</li>
                <li>document character encoding and the

                  attributes</li>

                    <code class="event">readystatechanged</code> event, and the
                    <code class="domattribute">readyState</code> DOM attribute</li>

          following changes were made:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>In the “Boolean attributes” subsection, the

            attribute’s canonical name” (the statement had
            previously required non-empty values to be in

            <li>In the “Tokens” subsection, the following

            <blockquote>
              <p><q>Sets of space-separated tokens sometimes have
                a defined set of allowed values. When a set of

          <p>This section introduces the terms “semantics”,
          “structure”, “transparent”, and “paragraph” in the
          specific context of the HTML language, as well as
          defining a number of categories that HTML content can be
          grouped into. In this section, the following changes
          were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the “Semantics” subsection, a general statement
            about authoring conformance was re-written to now
            read, <q>Authors must not use elements, attributes,
              and attribute values for purposes other than their
              appropriate intended semantic purpose.</q>, and a
            minor refinement was made to the accompanying
            example.</li>
            <li>In the “Structure” subsection, the following
            statement was <strong>removed</strong> completely:
            <q>Authors must only put elements inside an element if
              that element allows them to be there according to
              its content model</q>, and (in a later part of the
            same subsection), a general statement about authoring
            conformance was re-written to now read, <q>Authors
              must not use elements in the HTML namespace anywhere
              except where they are explicitly allowed, as defined
              for each element, or as explicitly required by other
              specifications</q>.</li>
            <li>Also in the “Structure” subsection, a statement
            was added that cites an example of a structural
            conformance requirement in the Atom specification, and
            a statement was added that <q>elements in the HTML
              namespace may be orphan nodes (i.e. without a parent
              node)</q>, along with an example.</li>
            <li>In the “Kinds of content” subsection (and
            throughout the rest of the section and the
            specification), the term “prose content” was changed
            to <strong>flow content</strong>.</li>
            <li>In the “Transparent content models” subsection, a
            minor wording change was made.</li>

            <li>The <code class="htmlattribute">style</code> attribute

            <li>The <code class="htmlattribute">onstorage</code> attribute
            was added to the list of global attributes.</li>
            <li>The following conformance statement was added:

              <p><q>custom data attributes (e.g.
                data-foldername or data-msgid) can be specified on

                the page.</q></p>
            </blockquote>
            Also, an “Embedding custom non-visible data” subsection
            was added, with conformance criteria related to
            <code class="htmlattribute">data-</code> attributes and
            the associated <code class="domattribute">dataset</code>
            DOM attribute.</li>
            <li>The following conformance statement was added:
            <blockquote>
              <p><q>In HTML documents, the html element,
                and any other elements in the HTML namespace whose

            <li>A new “The xml:base attribute (XML only)”
            subsection was added, with the following text:
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>The xml:base attribute is defined in XML

          changes were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The wording for the entire “Focus” subsection was
            refactored to make “define .focus(), .blur(),
            onfocus, and onblur in a way that doesn’t require an
            infinite loop in the face of a hostile author, and
            that is better defined in terms of multiple iframes,
            windows, and orphaned elements”, and to provide the
            following definition of “focusable”: <q>An element is
              focusable if the tabindex attribute’s definition
              above defines the element to be focusable and the
              element is being rendered.</q> and, for the case
            where the <code class="method">scrollIntoView()</code>
            method is called, to provide the following additional
            requirement:
            <q>Visual user agents should
              further scroll horizontally as necessary to bring
              the element to the attention of the user.</q></li>
            <li>Also, in the “Focus” subsection, a change was made
            to correctly document the <code class="method">hasFocus()</code> method as a method
            (previously, the interface definition had incorrectly
            indicated that it was an attribute).</li>

            <p>In this section, the following changes were
            made:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The
              <code class="htmlattribute">sizes</code>
              content attribute was added to the list of conformant
              attributes for the element, and the
              <code class="domattribute">sizes</code>
              DOM attribute was added to the interface definition for
              the <code>HTMLLinkElement</code> interface.</li>
              <li>Conformance criteria for the 
              <code class="htmlattribute">sizes</code>
              content attribute and

              DOM attribute were added.</li>
              <li>The following note was added: <q>Hyperlinks
                created with the link element and its rel
                attribute apply to the whole page. This contrasts
                with the rel attribute of a and area elements,
                which indicates the type of a link whose context
                is given by the link’s location within the
                document.</q></li>
              <li>Other refinements were made
              to language in this section, including the addition
              of the following statements:
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>HTTP semantics must be followed when
                  fetching external resources. (For example,
                  redirects must be followed and 404 responses must
                  cause the external resource to not be
                  applied.)</q></p>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>If no type metadata is specified, but
                  the external resource link type has a default type
                  defined, then the user agent must assume that the

              <li>The text of the “Specifying the document’s
              character encoding” subsection was refined, with the
              following statements added:
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>If the document contains a meta element with
                  a charset attribute or a meta element in the

                  encoding used must be an ASCII-compatible
                  character encoding.</q></p>
                <p><q>An ASCII-compatible character encoding is one
                  that is a superset of US-ASCII (specifically,
                  ANSI_X3.4-1968) for bytes in the range 0x09 -

              </blockquote>
              </li><li>The value <code>dns</code> was removed from the

              attribute.</li>
              <li>The value 
              <code>description</code>

                  application, the application-name metadata name must
                  not be used.  User agents may use the application
                  name in UI in preference to the page’s title, since
                  the title might include status messages and the like
                  relevant to the status of the page at a particular

              </li>
              <li>The

              and corresponding
              <code>Encoding declaration</code>
              state added to a table that lists conformant keyword
              values for the

              attribute and their corresponding states; also, a
              definition for the 
              <code>Encoding declaration</code>
              state was added, and refinements were made in the

              subsection.</li>
              <li>A part of the “Refresh state” algorithm was

            <p>Several parts of this section were extensively
            re-written. Among some of the specific changes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The term <strong>sectioning roots</strong> has
              been introduced and defined.</li>
              <li>In the “Creating an outline”, a numbered set of
              steps was added to define the outline algorithm, and
              other details were added.</li>
              <li>In the final subsection, the term “headers” has
              been replaced by “headings”, including in the title,
              which now reads “Distinguishing site-wide headings
              from page headings”, and some refinements were made
              to the wording of the subsection.</li>

              attributes for the element, and the

              DOM attribute was added to the interface definition for

              <li>A statement defining the meaning of the element,

              elements)“, was revised to read, <q>The ol element
              represents a list of items, where the items have

                reversed attribute is a boolean attribute. If
                present, it indicates that the list is a
                descending list (..., 3, 2, 1). If the attribute
                is omitted, the list is an ascending list (1, 2,
                3, ...).</q></li>
              <li>Conformance statements relevant to the

            <p>The <code class="element">m</code> element was
            renamed <code class="element">mark</code>; in this
            section, the set of examples was
            significantly enlarged, and the text defining the
            meaning of the element, which had read simply, “The m
            element represents a run of text marked or
            highlighted”, was expanded to read:</p>
            <blockquote>

                text in one document marked or highlighted for

                another context. When used in a quotation or other
                block of text referred to from the prose, it
                indicates a highlight that was not originally
                present but which has been added to bring the
                reader’s attention to a part of the text that
                might not have been considered important by the
                original author when the block was originally
                written, but which is now under previously
                unexpected scrutiny. When used in the main prose
                of a document, it indicates a part of the document
                that has been highlighted due to its likely

              describing a mechanism by which the <code class="element">dfn</code> element could be used to
              enable automatic cross-references has been removed
              completely, and replaced by a statement that <q>An a

            <p>Refinements and changes were made to the text in

            <ul>
              <li>The text defining the meaning of the <code class="element">abbr</code> element was refined to
              now read (changes highlighted): <q>The abbr element
                represents an abbreviation or acronym, <em class="highlight">optionally with its
                  expansion</em>. The title attribute <em class="highlight">may</em> be used to provide an

                expansion of the abbreviation, <em class="highlight">and nothing else</em>.</q>
              </li>
              <li>The following statement was
              <strong>removed</strong> completely: “The title
              attribute may be omitted if there is a dfn element
              in the document whose defining term is the
              abbreviation (the textContent of the abbr
              element).”</li>
              <li>The following authoring-conformance requirement
              was added: <q>If an abbreviation is pluralised, the
                expansion’s grammatical number (plural vs
                singular) must match the grammatical number of the
                contents of the element.</q></li>
              <li>The set of examples was expanded and includes
              the addition of an example prefaced by the following
              text: <q>This paragraph marks up an abbreviation
                without giving an expansion, possibly as a hook to
                apply styles for abbreviations (e.g.
                smallcaps).</q>

            <p>In this section, a conformance statement was

              attribute must return <code>-1</code></q>. (The
            statement had previously indicated that is should
            return <code>1</code>.) Also, the following note was
            added:
            <q>The progress element is the wrong element to use
              for something that is just a gauge, as opposed to
              task progress. For instance, indicating disk space
              usage using progress would be inappropriate.
              Instead, the meter element is available for such use
              cases.</q></p>

              <code>HTMLMeterElement</code> interface, the data
              type for all attributes was changed from
              <code>long</code> to <code>float</code>.</li>
              <li>A statement providing authoring requirements was
              changed to now read (change highlighted): <q> The
                recommended way of giving the value is to include
                it as contents of the element, either as two
                numbers (the higher number represents the maximum,
                the other number the current value, <em class="highlight">and the minimum is assumed to be

              <li>A statement regarding the conformant values for

            <p>In this section, the following changes were made:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The title of a subsection that discusses
              specific use cases from the element was changed from
              “A key part of the content that doesn’t have an
              obvious textual alternative” to simply, “A key part of

              changed to now read:
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>In some cases, the image is a critical
                  part of the content. This could be the case, for
                  instance, on a page that is part of a photo
                  gallery. The image is the whole point of the page
                  containing it.</q></p>
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                <p><q>When it is possible for alternative
                  text to be provided, for example if the image is
                  part of a series of screenshots in a magazine
                  review, or part of a comic strip, or is a
                  photograph in a blog entry about that photograph,
                  text that conveys can serve as a substitute for
                  the image must be given as the contents of the alt
                  attribute.</q></p>
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                <p><q>In a rare subset of these cases, there
                  might be no alternative text available. This could
                  be the case, for instance, on a photo upload site,
                  if the site has received 8000 photos from a user
                  without the user annotating any of them. In such
                  cases, the alt attribute may be omitted, but the
                  alt attribute should be included, with a useful
                  value, if at all possible.</q></p>
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                <p><q>In any case, if an image is a key part
              of the content, the alt attribute must not be
              specified with an empty value.</q></p>
              </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>The <code class="htmlattribute">alt</code> text for the
              “Screenshot of a KDE desktop” example was expanded.</li>
              <li>The prefatory text for one of the examples was updated
              to read: <q>A photo on a photo-sharing site, if the site
                received the image with no metadata other than the
                caption.</q></li>
              <li>A portion of a note that had read, “the alt attribute
              should only be omitted when no alternative text is
              available and none can be made available, e.g. on

              <li>A statement that had read, “Once the download has
              completed, if the image is a valid image, the user agent
              must fire a load event on the img element” was emended to

              <li>A note was added with the following text: <q>The value

                executing.</q></li>
              <li>Some additional examples were added, prefaced by the
              following text:
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>A single image can have different

                <p><q> In each of the following cases, the same
                  image is used, yet the alt text is different each
                  time.</q></p>

                instantiate third-party handlers. This
                specification does not define a mechanism for
                interacting with third-party handlers, as it is
                expected to be user-agent-specific. Some UAs might
                opt to support a plugin mechanism such as the
                Netscape Plugin API; others may use remote content
                convertors or have built-in support for certain

              <li>Revisions were made to conformance requirements
              related to the case where the
              <code class="element">video</code>
              element is paused.</li>
              <li>In a section of the text that concerns where
              video content is rendered inside the element’s
              playback area, the term “aspect ratio” was changed
              to <q>adjusted aspect ratio</q>, and a statement was
              added to say, <q>The
                adjusted aspect ratio of a video is the ratio of
                its adjusted width to its intrinsic height. The
                adjusted width of a video is its intrinsic width
                multiplied by its pixel ratio.</q></li>
              <li>The following editorial note was added: “The
              spec does not currently define the interaction of
              the “controls” attribute with the “height” and
              “width” attributes. This will likely be defined in
              the rendering section based on implementation
              experience. So far, browsers seem to be making the
              controls overlay-only, thus somewhat sidestepping
              the issue.”</li>

              <li>The following statements were added:
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>Arguments other than the contextId
                  must be ignored, and must not cause the user

                  either its horizontal dimension or its vertical
                  dimension is zero) then the method must return
                  the string “data:,”. (This is the shortest data:
                  URI; it represents the empty string in a

              <li>A note concerning the case of trying to use the

              image types other than PNG was emended to read
              (added text highlighted):
              <blockquote>
                <p><q>When trying to use types other than
                  image/png, authors can check if the image was
                  really returned in the requested format by
                  checking to see if the returned string starts
                  with one the exact strings “data:image/png,” or
                  “data:image/png;”. If it does, the image is PNG,
                  and thus the requested type was not supported.
                  (The one exception to this is if the canvas has
                  either no height or no width, in which case the
                  result might simply be
                  “data:,”.)</q></p>

              made:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the interface definition for the
                <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> interface,
                the following DOM attributes were added:
                <ul>
                  <li><code class="domattribute">font</code></li>

                  <li><code class="domattribute">textBaseline</code></li>
                </ul>
                Also, the following methods were added:

                </ul>
                In addition, the <code>TextMetrics</code>
                interface was added.</li>
                <li>A number of significant refinements were made
                to existing text throughout various
                subsections.</li>
                <li>A new and extensive “Text” subsection was
                added. It concerns rendering of text to a
                canvas.</li>
                <li>A new “Security with canvas elements”
                subsection was added. It begins with the following
                statement:
                <blockquote><p>
                  <q>Information leakage can occur if
                    scripts from one origin are exposed to images
                    from another origin (one that isn’t the
                    same).</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><q>To mitigate this, canvas elements
                    are defined to have a flag indicating whether
                    they are origin-clean. All canvas elements
                    must start with their origin-clean set to
                    true.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                It then lists a specific set actions, each of
                which must cause the <var>origin-clean</var> flag
                to be set to <code>false</code>. In addition, it
                includes the following statements:
                <blockquote>
                  <p><q>Whenever the toDataURL() method of
                    a canvas element whose origin-clean flag is
                    set to false is called, the method must
                    immediately raise a security
                    exception.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><q>Whenever the getImageData() method
                    of the 2D context of a canvas element whose
                    origin-clean flag is set to false is called,
                    the method must immediately raise a security
                    exception.</q></p>

          <p>An introduction was added for this section. The full
          text of that introduction reads:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><q>Scripts allow authors to add interactivity
              to their documents.</q></p>

            <p><q>Authors are encouraged to use declarative
            alternatives to scripting where possible, as declarative
            mechanisms are often more maintainable, and many users
            disable scripting.</q></p>

          <p><q>For example, instead of using script to show or hide
            a section to show more details, the details element
            could be used.</q></p>

          <p><q>Authors are also encouraged to make their
            applications degrade gracefully in the absence of
            scripting support.</q></p>

          <p><q>For example, if an author provides a link in a table
            header to dynamically resort the table, the link could
            also be made to function without scripts by requesting
            the sorted table from the server.</q></p>

              attributes for the element, and the

              DOM attribute was added to the interface definition for

            <p>In this section, the following changes were
            made:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The content model for the element was updated to
              change instances of the phrases “when scripting is
              disabled” and “when scripting is enabled” to instead
              use the terms “without script” and “with
              script”, and statements within the text of the
              section were revised to use those terms.</li>
              <li>The following note was added:
              <q>The noscript element is only effective in the HTML
                serialization, it has no effect in the XML
                serialization.</q></li>
              <li>The following note was added: <q>The noscript
                element interacts poorly with the designMode
                feature. Authors are encouraged to not use

          <p>This section defines a <strong>browsing
            context</strong> as “a collection of one or more
          Document objects, and one or more
          <strong>views</strong>, as well as particular browsing
          contexts, including the <strong>active
            document</strong>“. In this section, the following
          changes were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A statement related to creation of a browsing
            context was updated to read (added text highlighted):
            <q>When a browsing context is first created, it must
              be created with a single Document in its session
              history, whose address is about:blank, which is
              marked as being an HTML document, <em class="highlight">and whose character encoding is
                UTF-8</em>.</q></li>
            <li>A description was added of how the
            <strong>origin</strong> of the
            <code>about:blank</code> <code>Document</code> object
            is set.</li>
            <li>In the “Nested browsing contexts” subsection, the
            following statements were added:
            <blockquote>
              <p><q>The transitive closure of parent browsing
                contexts for a nested browsing context 
                gives the list of ancestor browsing
                contexts.</q></p>
              <p><q>A nested browsing context can have a
                seamless browsing context flag set, if it is
                embedded through an iframe element with a
                seamless attribute.</q></p>
            </blockquote></li>
            <li>A definition of the concept of an <strong>ancestor of
              a browsing context</strong> was added.</li>
            <li>A “Security” subsection was added, with a
            definition of the concept of <strong>allowed to
              navigate</strong>.</li>
            <li>In the “Browsing context names” subsection, a
            number of changes were made — among them, the addition
            of conformance statements related to the condition of
            the <strong>sandboxed navigation browsing context
              flag</strong> being set — and a statement was added
            that <q>User agent implementors are encouraged to
              provide a way for users to configure the user agent
              to always reuse the current browsing
              context.</q></li>

          <p>This section defines the interface for the
          <code>Window</code> object. In this section, the
          following changes were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The interface definition was updated for
            consistency with the Web IDL specification <a href="#webidl">[WebIDL]</a> and to refer
            to the <code class="domattribute">localStorage</code>
            attribute (which was previously named <code class="domattribute">globalStorage</code> and to add
            the <code class="method">showModalDialog</code> and
            <code class="method">XXX4</code>
            methods and <code class="domattribute">onstorage</code> attribute.
            (Note that the “<code class="method">XXX4</code>“
            name is simply a placeholder; it is not intended that
            the method will be implemented with that literal name.)</li>
            <li>In the “Security” subsection, the <code class="method">XXX4</code> and <code class="domattribute">frames</code> attribute were
            added to the list of exceptions.</li>
            <li>In the “APIs for creating and navigating browsing
            contexts by name” subsection, the phrase “valid
            browsing context name” was emended to become <q>valid
              browsing context name or keyword</q>, and
            conformance requirements related to using the
            <strong>script execution context</strong> were
            added.</li>
            <li>In the “Accessing other browsing contexts”
            subsection, for consistency with the Web IDL <a href="#webidl">[WebIDL]</a>
            specification, language that stated conformance
            requirements for ECMAScript implementations was
            removed, and requirements were added in relation to
            the condition of the <strong>sandboxed origin browsing

          <p>This section, which had been a subsection
          of the “Scripting” section, was moved up a level in the
          section hierarchy to instead become a sibling to section
          to the “Scripting” section. This section defines the
          <strong>origin</strong> and <strong>effective script
            origin</strong> of a resource (a URI, a script, or a
          <code>Document</code> object or image). In this section,
          the following changes were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The term <strong>effective script origin</strong>
            has been introduced, and its characteristics defined
            along with those of the term <strong>origin</strong>.</li>
            <li>The word “origin” was replaced by “value” in the
            sentence that now reads, “If the scheme is ‘file’, then
            the user agent may return a UA-specific value”</li>
            <li>Some instances of the phrase “the same as the
            origin” were refined to read “equal to the
            origin”.</li>
            <li>The criteria for determining origin and effective
            script origin were reorganized and expanded, with the
            “Unscripted same-origin checks” subsection being moved
            to become the “For URIs” part of that list of
            criteria.</li>
            <li>An algorithm was added for determining the whether
            any two given origins are of the <strong>same
              origin</strong></li>
            <li>A new “Relaxing the same-origin restriction”
            subsection was added, with most of the content of that
            subsection being content moved out from the “Resource
            metadata management” subsection within the “The Document
            Object Model” major section. This “Relaxing the
            same-origin restriction” now more explicitly defines an
            algorithm that must be run when setting the <code class="domattribue">domain</code> attribute on
            <code>Document</code> objects.</li>

          <p>This section provides conformance criteria
          related to mechanisms that can cause author-provided
          executable code to run in the context of a document
          scripting, as well as defining the states
          <strong>scripting is enabled</strong> and
          <strong>scripting is disabled</strong>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A new “Script execution contexts” subsection was
            added to define the <strong>script execution
              context</strong> of a script. It also introduces the
            term <strong>without script</strong> and the term
            <strong>with script</strong> (<q>A
              node is said to be with script if it is not without
              script</q>), along with the following editorial
            note: <q>If you can find a better pair of terms than
              “with script” and “without script” let me know. The
              only things I can find that are less confusing are
              also way, way longer.</q></li>
            <li>In the “The javascript: protocol” subsection, some
            clarifying language was added, and the case for the
            “dereference context” that had previously stated that it
            must be “the browsing context of the Document to which
            belongs the element for which the URI is being
            dereferenced, or to which the style sheet for which the
            URI is being dereferenced applies, whichever is
            appropriate” was changed to instead say that it must be
            an empty object for that same case; also, the
            following note was added: <q>The rules for handling
              script execution in a script execution context
              include making the script not execute (and just
              return void) in certain cases, e.g. in a sandbox or
              when the user has disabled scripting altogether.</q></li>
            <li>In the “Events” subsection, a
            number of changes were made — among them, the addition
            of the <code class="event">onstorage</code> event to the list of
            event handler attributes that must be supported by all
            HTML elements and on <code>Window</code> objects. Also,
            a statement related to the <strong>script execution
              context</strong> was added, and, in the
            same subsection, a clarifying statement that <q>The
              listener argument is emphatically not the event
              handler attribute itself.</q> Also, for consistency
            with the Web IDL specification <a href="#webidl">[WebIDL]</a>, some statements that
            provided conformance criteria for ECMAScript DOM
            bindings were removed. </li>

          <p>This section provides conformance criteria
          related to dialogs presented to users. In this section,
          the following changes were made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The existing content of this section was moved,
            unchanged, to become the “Simple dialogs”

            <li>A new “Dialogs implemented using separate

            how user agents must behave when the <code class="method">showModalDialog()</code> method is
            invoked.</li>
            <li>A new “Notifications” subsection was added. That

              bring the user’s attention to new information, or
              remind the user of scheduled events</q>, and defines
            a new <code class="method">showNotification()</code>
            method.</li>
            <li>A new “Printing” subsection was added. It defines
            steps that take place when the
            <code class="method">print()</code>

            <li>An item for the <code>

          <p>This section was formed by combining the existing
          “Client-side session and persistent storage of
          name/value pairs” and “Client-side database storage”
          sections with common sections related to disk space,
          security, and privacy. A number of changes were made in
          these content that is now in this section — among those
          changes are the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some instances of “origin” were changed to
            “site”.</li>
            <li>In the “Storing name/value pairs” subsection, the
            <code class="domattribute">globalStorage</code> DOM
            attribute was renamed to <code class="domattribute">localStorage</code>.</li>
            <li>The “Storing name/value pairs” subsection also
            adds an definition for the <code class="interface">StorageEvent</code> interface, with
            <code class="method">initStorageEvent()</code> and <code class="method">initStorageEventNS()</code>
            methods.</li>
            <li>Also in the “Storing name/value pairs” subsection,
            some instances of the term “origin” were changed to
            “site”; for example, in the statement that now reads
            <q>Each site has its own separate storage area.</q></li>
            <li>The “Disk space” and “Security and privacy” parts
            of the “Miscellaneous implementation requirements for
            storage areas” subsection of the “Client-side session
            and persistent storage of name/value pairs” section
            were moved to become shared sibling sections of both
            the “Storing name/value pairs” and “Database storage”
            subsections.</li>
            <li>In the “Database storage” subsection, the
            following editorial note was added:
            <blockquote>
              <p><q>Implementation feedback is requested on
                what to do with arguments that are of types that
                are not supported by the underlying SQL backend.
                For example, SQLite doesn’t support booleans, so
                what should the UA do if passed a boolean? The
                Gears team suggests failing, not silently
                converting types.</q></p>
            </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>Also in the “Database storage” subsection, the
            interface definition for the
            <code>SQLResultSetRowList</code> interface was updated
            for consistency with the Web IDL specification <a href="#webidl">[WebIDL]</a>.</li>

          <p>This section provides conformance criteria
          related to handling of hyperlinks. This section remains
          largely unchanged, though some significant changes were
          made to — among those, the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the “Hyperlink elements” subsection, the phrase
            “valid browsing context name” was emended to become
            <q>valid browsing context name or keyword</q>.</li>
            <li>In the “Following hyperlinks” subsection, a
            statement related to the <strong>source browsing
              context</strong> was added.</li>
            <li>Particularly significant changes were made to the
            “Hyperlink auditing” subsection (which states
            requirements for HTTP-request behavior when a user
            follows a hyperlink for an <code class="element">a</code>
            or <code class="element">area</code> element that has a
            <code class="htmlattribute">ping</code> attribute); a
            statement was added that <q>All relevant cookie and HTTP
              authentication headers must be included in the
              request. Which other headers are required depends on
              the URIs involved</q>, and criteria was added for
            conditions under which <code>Ping-From</code>,
            <code>Ping-To</code>, and <code>Referer</code> HTTP
            headers must be included.</li>
            <li>In the “Link types” section, the link type
            “contact” was removed from the table that lists
            conformant link types.</li>
            <li>The subsection that defined that “contact” link
            type was completely removed.</li>
            <li>In the subsection that defines the “icon” link
            type, the following changes were made:
              <ul>
                <li>A definition was added for the <code class="htmlattribute">sizes</code> attribute (for
                specifying sizes for icon link types) and its
                conformant values</li>
                <li>The
                <code class="htmlattribute">type</code> attribute was
                added to the set of attributes that user agents must
                use when to select the most appropriate icon when
                multiple icons are available.</li>
                <li>The following statement was added:
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><q>If the user agent tries to use an icon but
                      that icon is determined, upon closer
                      examination, to in fact be inappropriate (e.g.
                      because it uses an unsupported format), then the
                      user agent must try the next-most-appropriate
                      icon as determined by the attributes.</q></p>
                  </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>Text which had stated that “If there are multiple
                equally appropriate icons, user agents must use the
                first one declared in tree order” was revised to read,
                <q>If there are multiple equally appropriate icons,
                  user agents must use the <em class="highlight">last</em> one declared in tree
                  order.</q></li>
                <li>In reference to the
                <code class="htmlattribute">sizes</code>
                attribute, the following statement was added:
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><q>If the attribute is not specified, then
                      the user agent must assume that the given
                      icon is appropriate, but less appropriate
                      than an icon of a known and appropriate
                      size.</q></p>
                  </blockquote>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In the subsection that defines the “nofollow” link
            type, a statement was emended to now read (add text
            highlighted), <q>The nofollow keyword indicates that
              the link is not endorsed by the original author or
              publisher of the page<em class="highlight">, or that
                the link to the referenced document was included
                primarily because of a commercial relationship
                between people affiliated with the two
                pages</em>.</q>
              </li><li>In the subsection that defines the “prefetch”
              link
            type, a statement was added that <q>There is no
              default type for resources given by the “prefetch”
              keyword.</q></li>
            <li>In the subsection that defines the “stylesheet” link
            type, a statement was added that <q>The default type
              for resources given by the stylesheet keyword is
              text/css</q>, and a description was added of
            quirks-mode behavior with respect to this link
            type.</li>
            <li>In the subsection that defines the “UP” link
            type, a statement was added that <q>Only one link is
              created for the set of one or more “up” keywords
              and, if present, the “index” keyword.</q>

            attribute.</li>
            <li>In the “User editing actions” subsection, the
            following statement was added: “User agents may
            prevent selections from being made in ways that cross
            from editable elements into non-editable elements
            (e.g. by making each non-editable descendant
            atomically selectable, but not allowing text selection
            within them).”</li>
            <li>Language was added to state that UAs should should
            offer a way for the user to delete “non-editable
            descendants”.</li>
            <li>A general statement that “UAs should offer a way
            for the user to mark text as having stress emphasis
            and as being important” was removed, and the following
            statements were added:
            <blockquote>
              <p><q>In response to a request from a user to

        <p>Applications written in HTML often require mechanisms
        to communicate with remote servers, as well mechanisms
        for applications from different domains running on the
        same client to communicate with each other (so-called
        “cross-document messaging”). This section defines APIs for
        enabling those classes of communication; specifically,
        APIs for cross-document messaging, for server-sent DOM
        events, and for network connections — as well as providing
        the interface definitions for messages sent in
        cross-document messaging and server-sent DOM events.</p>

            elements and handling of newlines inserted after the

            <li>In the “Elements” subsection, the category
            <strong>foreign elements</strong> was added to the
            list of kinds of elements, the definition of 
            foreign elements as <q>Elements from the MathML
            namespace</q> was added, and other parts of the section
            were updated to add language related to foreign
            elements.</li>
            <li>Also in the “Elements” subsection, the range
            “U+0030 DIGIT ZERO .. U+0039 DIGIT NINE” was added to
            the set of allowed characters in tag names.</li>
            <li>Also in the “Elements” subsection, the description
            of allowed characters for attribute names and unquoted
            attribute value syntax were refined, and statements
            were added to make it clear that a space is required
            after a quoted attribute value and any following
            attribute.</li>
            <li>Also in the “Elements” subsection, refinements
            were made to the description of conditions under which
            certain tags can be omitted.</li>
            <li>Also in the “Elements” subsection, the following
            statement was <strong>removed</strong> completely:
            <blockquote>
              <p><q>A p element must not contain
                blockquote, dl, menu, ol, pre, table, or ul
                elements, even though these elements are
                technically allowed inside p elements according to
                the content models described in this
                specification. (In fact, if one of those elements
                is put inside a p element in the markup, it will
                instead imply a p element end tag before
                it.)</q></p>

            </li>
            <li>Also in the “Elements” subsection, the
            definition of <strong>escaping text span</strong> was
            refined.</li>
            <li>The title of the “Character entity references”
            subsection was changed to “Character references”, the
            term “Named entities” was changed to <q>Named character
            references</q>, and other instances of the term

            <li>Also in the “Character references” subsection, the
            definition of <strong>ambiguous ampersand</strong> was
            refined.</li>
            <li>A new “CDATA blocks” subsection was added.</li>
            <li>In the “Comments” subsection, the description of
            comments was refined to add the constraint that
            comments <q>must not start with a single U+003E
              GREATER-THAN SIGN (‘&gt;‘) character, nor start with a

                encoding is UTF-16, change it to UTF-8”, was updated
                to now read (changed text highlighted), <q>If the
                  new encoding is <em class="highlight">a UTF-16
                    encoding</em>, change it to UTF-8.</q></li>
                <li>Also, in the “Changing the encoding while
                parsing” subsection, the following statement,
                which had been placed at the end of the algorithm,
                was <strong>removed</strong> completely: <q>While
                  the invocation of this algorithm is not a parse
                  error, it is still indicative of non-conforming
                  content.</q></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Significant revisions were made to the “Character
            encoding requirements” subsection, including the
            addition of a “Character encoding overrides” table,
            and the refinement of an accompanying note to now
            read, <q>The requirement to treat certain encodings as
              other encodings according to the table above is a
              willful violation of the W3C Character Model
              specification.</q></li>
            <li>A new “Parse state” subsection was added.</li>
            <li>The algorithm for resetting the insertion mode was
            refined for the case of <code class="domattribute">innerHTML</code> used with
            <code class="element">td</code>
            and
            <code class="element">th</code>.</li>
            <li>A new “The scripting state” subsection was added,
            with the following text: <q>The scripting flag
              is set to “enabled” if the Document with which
              the parser is associated was with script when
              the parser was created, and “disabled”
              otherwise.</q></li>
            <li>In the “Tokenisation” subsection, a number of
            changes were made — among them, the addition of an
            <q>After attribute value (quoted) state</q>, a
            <q>Self-closing start tag state</q>, and a <q>CDATA
              block state</q>. Also, statements that had referred
            to setting the public identifier and system identifier
            to “the empty string” were emended to read refer to
            setting them to <q>the empty string (not missing)</q>;
              statements that referred to the state in which the
              public identifier or system identifier was “not set”
              were revised to instead refer to those as being the
              case were a public identifier or system identifier
              was “missing”, and the following statement was
              added: <q>A system identifier whose value is the
                empty string is not considered missing for the
                purposes of the conditions above.</q></li>
            <li>In the “Tree construction” subsection, a number of
            changes were made — among them, the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Descriptions were added for handling
                <strong>foreign elements</strong> and
                <strong>foreign attributes</strong>.</li>
                <li>More doctypes were added to the list of
                “quirks mode” doctypes, all doctypes that ended in
                <code>//EN</code> were revised to drop the
                <code>//EN</code>, and the accompanying text was
                changed to say that instead of the public
                identifier being “set to” a particular doctype
                string that it instead “starts with” that
                particular doctype string.</li>
                <li>A new “Foster parenting” subsection was
                created; its contents were formed by moving
                statements out from algorithms in other parts of
                the “Tree construction” section to form this new
                subsection.</li>
                <li>Statements related to handling of the
                <code class="element">ruby</code>,
                <code class="element">rp</code>,
                and
                <code class="element">rt</code>
                elements
                were added.</li>
                <li>The tree-construction algorithm was refined to
                allow the
                <code class="element">noframes</code>
                element
                as a child of the 
                <code class="element">head</code>
                element, and to cause a
                <code class="element">textarea</code>
                element
                within a
                <code class="element">select</code>
                element to imply an end tag for the 
                <code class="element">select</code>
                element.</li>
                <li>Algorithms in this section were updated to
                define handling of a number of elements that are
                newly added in HTML5, including
                <code class="element">command</code>,
                <code class="element">event-source</code>,
                <code class="element">article</code>,
                <code class="element">aside</code>,
                <code class="element">datagrid</code>,
                <code class="element">dialog</code>,
                <code class="element">footer</code>,
                <code class="element">header</code>,
                <code class="element">nav</code>,
                <code class="element">section</code>,
                <code class="element">param</code>,
                <code class="element">source</code>,
                </li>
                <li>The following step was added in the “The ‘in
                body’ insertion mode” subsection:
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><q>An end tag whose tag name is
                      “sarcasm”</q></p>
                    <p><q>Take a deep breath, then act as described
                      in the “any other end tag” entry
                      below.</q></p>
                  </blockquote>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A number of instances of the phrase “if
            scripting is enabled” were changed to read, <q>if the
              scripting flag is enabled.</q></li>
            <li>In the “The end” subsection, language related to
            <strong>current document readiness</strong> was
            added.</li>

        <p>This section is intended to provide

        <p>This mostly non-normative section describes certain
