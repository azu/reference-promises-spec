<p>
To foster the development of the Linked Data Platform specification, this document includes a set of user stories, use cases, scenarios and requirements that motivate a simple read-write Linked Data architecture, based on HTTP access to web resources that describe their state using RDF.
 The starting point for the development of these use cases is a collection of user stories that provide realistic examples describing how people may use read-write Linked Data. The use cases themselves are captured in a narrative style that describes a
 behavior, or set of behaviors based on, and using scenarios from, these user stories. The aim throughout has been to avoid details of protocol (specifically 
 the HTTP protocol), and use of any specific vocabulary that might be introduced by the 
 <abbr title="Linked Data Platform">LDP</abbr> specification.

<!--OddPage--><h2 role="heading" aria-level="1" id="scope"><span class="secno">1. </span>Scope and Motivation</h2>
	<p>
		Linked Data was defined by Tim Berners-Lee with the following
		guidelines [<cite><a href="#bib-LINKED-DATA" class="bibref">LINKED-DATA</a></cite>]:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Use URIs as names for things</li>
		<li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names</li>
		<li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information,
			using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)</li>
		<li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover
			more things</li>
	</ol>
	<p>These four rules have proven very effective in guiding and
		inspiring people to publish Linked Data on the web. The amount of
		data, especially public data, available on the web has grown
		rapidly, and an impressive number of extremely creative and useful
		“mashups” have been created using this data as result.</p>
	
	<p>The goal for the [<cite><a href="#bib-LINKED-DATA-PLATFORM" class="bibref">LINKED-DATA-PLATFORM</a></cite>] is
		to define a specification required to allow the definition of a
		writable Linked Data API equivalent to the simple application APIs
		that are often written on the web today using the Atom Publishing
		Protocol (APP), which shares some characteristics with Linked Data
		such as the use of HTTP and URLs but relying on a flexible data model based on RDF that allows for
		multiple representations.</p>

			capture statements about system requirements written from a user

			This document redacts a number of user stories around the theme of read/writeable linked data.

	<p>Many of us have multiple email accounts that include
		information about the people and organizations we interact with –
		names, email addresses, telephone numbers, instant messenger
		identities and so on. When someone’s email address or telephone
		number changes (or they acquire a new one), our lives would be
		much simpler if we could update that information in one spot and
		all copies of it would automatically be updated. In other words,
		those copies would all be linked to some definition of “the
		contact.” There might also be good reasons (like off-line email
		addressing) to maintain a local copy of the contact, but ideally
		any copies would still be linked to some central “master.”</p>
	<p>Agreeing on a format for “the contact” is not enough,
		however. Even if all our email providers agreed on the format of a
		contact, we would still need to use each provider’s custom
		interface to update or replace the provider’s copy, or we would
		have to agree on a way for each email provider to link to the
		“master”. If we look outside our own personal interests, it would
		be even more useful if the person or organization exposed their
		own contact information so we could link to it.</p>
	<p>
		What would work in either case is a common understanding of the
		resource, a few formats needed, and access guidance for these
		resources. This would support how to acquire a link to a contact,
		how to use those links to interact with a contact (including <a href="#uc3" title="">reading</a>,
		<a href="#uc4" title="">updating</a>,
		and <a href="#s2.2" title="">deleting</a>
		it), as well as how to easily <a href="#s2.1" title="">create a
			new contact</a>, add it to my contacts, and when deleting a
		contact, how it would be removed from my list of contacts. It
		would also be good to be able to add some application-specific
		data about my contacts that the original design didn’t consider.
		Ideally we’d like to eliminate multiple copies of contacts, there
		would be additional valuable information about my contacts that
		may be stored on separate servers and need a simple way to link
		this information back to the contacts. Regardless of whether a
		contact collection is my own, shared by an organization, or all
		contacts known to an email provider (or to a single email account
		at an email provider), it would be nice if they all worked pretty
		much the same way.

	<p>In our daily lives, we deal with many different

		websites where we are uniquely identified by some string – an
		account number, user ID, and so on. We have to use their
		applications to interact with the data about us, and we
		have to use their identifier(s) for us.</p>
	<p>
		Would it not be simpler if at least the Web-addressable portion of
		that data could be linked to consistently, so that instead of

	<p>System and software development tools typically come from a
		diverse set of vendors and are built on various architectures and
		technologies. These tools are purpose built to meet the needs for
		a specific domain scenario (modeling, design, requirements and so
		on.) Often tool vendors view integrations with other tools as a
		necessary evil rather than providing additional value to their
		end-users. Even more of an afterthought is how these tools’ data
		-- such as people, projects, customer-reported problems and needs
		-- integrate and relate to corporate and external applications
		that manage data such as customers, business priorities and market
		trends. The problem can be isolated by standardizing on a small
		set of tools or a set of tools from a single vendor, but this
		rarely occurs and if does it usually does so only within small
		organizations. As these organizations grow both in size and
		complexity, they have needs to work with outsourced development
		and diverse internal other organizations with their own set of
		tools and processes. There is a need for better support of more
		complete business processes (system and software development
		processes) that span the roles, tasks, and data addressed by
		multiple tools. This demand has existed for many years, and the
		tools vendor industry has tried several different architectural
		approaches to address the problem. Here are a few:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implement an API for each application, and then, in each
			application, implement “glue code” that exploits the APIs of
			other applications to link them together.</li>
		<li>Design a single database to store the data of multiple
			applications, and implement each of the applications against this
			database. In the software development tools business, these
			databases are often called “repositories.”</li>
		<li>Implement a central “hub” or “bus” that orchestrates the
			broader business process by exploiting the APIs described
			previously.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		It is fair to say that although each of those approaches has its
		adherents and can point to some successes, none of them is wholly
		satisfactory. The use of Linked Data as an application integration
		technology has a strong appeal [<cite><a href="#bib-OSLC" class="bibref">OSLC</a></cite>].

	<p>For physicians to analyze, diagnose, and propose treatment

	<p>To diagnose a patient’s condition requires current data on

	<p>
		For infrastructure management (such as storage systems, virtual
		machine environments, and similar IaaS and PaaS concepts), it is
		important to provide an environment in which information from
		different sources can be <a href="#uc6" title="">aggregated</a>, <a href="#uc7" title="">filtered</a>,
		and visualized effectively. Specifically, the following use cases
		need to be taken into account:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>While some data sources are based on Linked Data, others
			are not, and aggregation and mashups must work across these
			different sources.</li>
		<li>Consumers of the data sources and aggregated/filtered
			data streams are not necessarily implementing Linked Data
			themselves, they may be off-the-shelf components such as
			dashboard frameworks for composing visualizations.</li>
		<li>Simple versions of this scenario are pull-based, where
			the data is requested from data sources. In more advanced
			settings, without a major change in architecture it should be
			possible to move to a push-based interaction model, where data
			sources push notifications to subscribers, and data sources
			provide different services that consumers can subscribe to (such
			as "informational messages" or "critical alerts only").</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In this scenario, the important factors are to have
		abstractions that allow easy aggregation and filtering, are
		independent from the internal data model of the sources that are
		being combined, and can be used for pull-based interactions as
		well as for push-based interactions.</p>

	<p>
		Several projects around the idea of <em>downscaling the Semantic Web</em> need to be able to ship payloads of RDF across
		the nodes member of a given network. The transfers are done in a
		constrained context in terms of bandwidth, scope of the local
		semantics employed by the nodes and computing capabilities of the
		nodes. In a P2P style, every node has the capability to act either
		as a data consumer or a data provider, serving its own data or
		acting as a relay to pass other's data along (typically in mesh
		networks).
	</p>
	<p>The transfer of an arbitrary payload of RDF data could be
		implemented through a container mechanism, adding and removing
		sets of RDF triples to it. Currently, the 
		SemanticXO [<cite><a href="#bib-XO" class="bibref">XO</a></cite>] project uses named graphs and the graph store protocol to
		create/delete/copy graphs across the nodes but this (almost)
		imposes the usage of a triple store. Unfortunately, triple stores
		are rather demanding pieces of software that are not always usable
		on limited hardware. Some generic REST-like interaction backed up
		with a lightweight column store would be a better approach.</p>

	<p>When publishing datasets about stars one may want to publish
		links to the pictures in which those stars appear, and this may

		publishing a picture of space we need to know which telescope took
		the picture, which part of the sky it was pointing at, what
		filters were used, which identified stars are visible, who can
		read it, who can write to it.</p>
	<p>If Linked Data contains information about resources that are
		most naturally expressed in non-RDF formats (be they binary such
		as pictures or videos, or human readable documents in XML
		formats), those non-RDF formats should be just as easy to publish
		to the LinkedData server as the RDF relations that link those
		resources up. A LinkedData server should therefore allow
		publishing of non-linked data resources too, and make it easy to
		publish and edit metadata about those resources.</p>
	<p>The resource comes in two parts - the image and information
		about the image (which may be in the image file but is better kept external
		to it as it's more general). The information about the image is
		vital. It's a compound item of image data and other data (application 
		metadata about the image) that are not distinguished from the

		The <em>Asset Description Metadata Schema</em> [<cite><a href="#bib-ADMS" class="bibref">ADMS</a></cite>]
		provides the data model to describe semantic asset repository
		contents, but this leaves many open challenges when building a
		federation of these repositories to serve the need of asset
		reuse. These include accessing and querying individual
		repositories and efficiently retrieving <a href="#uc5" title="">
			updated content</a> without having to retrieve the whole content.
		The Data Warehousing integration approach allows us to cope
		with heterogeneity of sources technologies and to benefit from the
		optimized performance it offers, given that individual
		repositories do not usually change frequently. With Data
		Warehousing, the federation requires one to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>understand the data, i.e. understand their semantic
			descriptions, and other systems.</li>
		<li>seamlessly exchange the semantic assets metadata from
			different repositories</li>
		<li>keep itself up-to-date.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Repository owners can maintain de-referenceable URIs for
		their repository descriptions and contained assets in a Linked Data
		compatible manner. ADMS provides the necessary data model to
		enable meaningful exchange of data. However, this leaves the

		systematic, standardized and cost efficient way. By using the same
		standards as on the Web, integration with applications will be
		simplified and higher-level interactions among resource
		constrained devices, abstracting away heterogeneities, will become
		possible. Up-coming IoT/WoT standards such as '6LowPAN' [<cite><a href="#bib-6LOWPAN" class="bibref">6LOWPAN</a></cite>]
		- IPv6 for resource constrained devices - and the <em>Constrained

		interfaces also on resource constrained devices, adhering to the
		Linked Data principles. Due to the limited resources available,

	<p>
		A number of user stories introduce the idea of a <em>container</em>
		as a mechanism for composing resources within the
		context of an application. A
		composition would be identified by URI being a linked resource in its own
		right. Its properties may represent the <em>affordances</em>
		of the application, enabling clients to determine what other
		operations they can do. These operations may
		include descriptions of application specific services that can be
		invoked by exchanging RDF documents.

	<p>
		Create a new container resource within the <abbr title="Linked Data Platform">LDP</abbr> server. In <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-services-supporting-the-process-of-science">Services Supporting the Process of Science</a>, 
			<a href="http://www.wf4ever-project.org/" title="http://www.wf4ever-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Research
			Objects</a> are semantically rich aggregations of resources that
		bring together data, methods and people in scientific
		investigations. A basic workflow research object will be created
		to aggregate scientific workflows and their artefacts [<cite><a href="#bib-RESEARCH-OBJECTS" class="bibref">RESEARCH-OBJECTS</a></cite>]. 		
		These artefacts will be added to the research object throughout the project lifecycle of the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		The RDF description below captures the initial state of the research object. For the purposes of the example, we have included the time of creation. It is a linked data resource addressed via URL from which the following RDF can be retrieved. The null-relative URL <code>&lt;&gt;</code> should be understood as a self-reference to the research object itself.

	<p>
		The motivation for nested containers comes from the <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-system-and-software-development-tool-integration">System and Software Development Tool Integration</a> user story. The
		OSLC Change Management vocabulary allows bug reports to have
		attachments referenced by the membership predicate
		<code>oslc_cm:attachment</code>. This may be viewed as nested containment. The <em>top-level-container</em> contains issues, and
		each issue is itself a container of attachments.
		In the example, <code>issue1234</code> is a member of the container <code>top-level-container</code>. In turn, <code>attachment324</code> and <code>attachment251</code> are attachments within <code>issue1234</code>. Treating these as containers makes it easier to manage them as self-contained units.

		This use case addresses the managed lifecycle of a resource and is

		managed in this way should ever be owned by more than one

		Resources begin life by being created within a container. From
		user story, <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-maintaining-social-contact-information">Maintaining Social Contact Information</a>, It should be
		possible to "easily create a new contact and add it to my
		contacts." This suggests that resource creation is closely linked
		to the application context. The new resource is created in a
		container representing "my contacts." The lifecycle of the
		resource is linked to the lifecycle of it's container. So, for
		example, if "my contacts" is deleted then a user would also
		reasonably expect that all contacts within it would also be
		deleted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Contact details are captured as an RDF description and it's
		properties, including "names, email addresses, telephone numbers,
		instant messenger identities and so on." The description may
		include non-standard RDF; "data about my contacts that the
		original design didn’t consider." The following RDF could be used
		to describe contact information using the FOAF
		vocabulary [<cite><a href="#bib-FOAF" class="bibref">FOAF</a></cite>]. A contact is represented here by a
		<code>foaf:PersonalProfileDocument</code> defining a resource that can be

		Delete a resource and all it's properties. If the resource resides

	<p>
		There is a requirement to be able to manage <em>collections</em> of
		resources. The concept of a collection overlaps with, but is
		distinct from that of a container. These collections are (weak)
		aggregations, unrelated to the lifecycle management of resources,
		and distinct from the ownership between a resource and its
		container. However, the composition of a container may be
		reflected as a collection to support navigation of the container
		and its contents. There is a need to be able to create collections
		by adding and deleting individual membership properties. Resources
		may belong to multiple collections, or to none.

	<p>
		Logically, a resource should not be owned by more than one
		container. However, it may be a member of multiple collections
		which define a weaker form of <em>aggregation</em>. As this is
		simply a manipulation of the RDF description of a collection, it
		should be possible to add the same resource to multiple
		collections.

		As a machine-readable collection of medical terms, the SNOMED CT ontology [<cite><a href="#bib-SNOMED" class="bibref">SNOMED</a></cite>]
		is of key importance in user story, <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-healthcare">Healthcare</a>. SNOMED CT allows concepts with more than one parent. In the example below, SNOMED concepts are treated as
		collections (aggregations) of narrower concepts. We see that the 
		concept <code>:TissueSpecimenFromHeart</code> belongs to two parent collections as it is both a  <code>:TissueSpecimen</code> and a <code>:SpecimenFromHeart</code>.
		This example also demonstrates how composition and aggregation support different scenarios, as the ability to have multiple parents should not be a possibility with composition.

	<p>
		This use case scenario, also based on <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-library-linked-data">Library Linked Data</a>,
		focuses on obtaining an item-level description of the resources
		aggregated by a collection. The simplest scenario is where the
		members of a collection are returned within a single
		representation, so that a client can explore the data by following
		these links. Different applications may use different membership
		predicates to capture this aggregation. The example below uses
		<code>rdfs:member</code>, but many different membership predicates are in
		common use, including RDF Lists. Item-level descriptions can be
		captured using the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic
		Records (FRBR) ontology [<cite><a href="#bib-FRBR" class="bibref">FRBR</a></cite>] [<cite><a href="#bib-FRBR-CORE" class="bibref">FRBR-CORE</a></cite>].
	</p>
	<p>
	Based on the example below, the item-level description should include as a minimum all the <code>rdfs:member</code> relationships. It need not include other properties of the collection, and it need not include additional properties of the members.

<p>This use case addresses a problem with the “resource-centric” approach to interacting with RDF data. The problem is that some resources participate in a very large number of triples, and therefore a “resource-centric” granularity leads to resource descriptions that are too large to be practically processed in a single HTTP request. This use case applies to all resources, not just containers.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>It's not really the resource description that's being paginated, but the values of a particular property.</li>
			<li>The server is responsible for pagination, and may decide how large the pages are.</li>
			<li>Pagination should apply symmetrically to both <em>incoming</em> and <em>outgoing</em> properties.</li>
			<li>The next-page URL should be treated as opaque.</li>

<p>In user story, <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-maintaining-social-contact-information">Maintaining Social Contact Information</a>, it is not uncommon for users to have a very large number of contacts.
This leads to a very large resource description, especially if some basic information about the contacts is included as well. The size of this representation may be so large that retrieval in a single HTTP request is impractical.</p>

<p>In this example the response to the first request includes a reference to the <code>next</code> resource in an ordered collection of resources. For the purposes of the example, we make use of the <code>next</code> property defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab">XHTML Metainformation Vocabulary</a>. There is no presumption that the <abbr title="Linked Data Platform">LDP</abbr> specification will recommend the use of this vocabulary.</p>

<p>When the client requests the resource identified by <code>next</code>, the response includes additional content that can be merged with the earlier data to construct a more complete model of the originally requested resource.

		A resource may have multiple <em>renditions</em>. For example, you
		can have a PDF and a JPEG representing the same thing. A user is
		trying to create a work order along with an attached image showing
		a faulty machine part. To the user and to the work order system,
		these two artifacts are managed as a set. A single request may
		create the work order, the attachment, and the relationship
		between them, atomically. When the user retrieves the work order
		later, they expect a single request by default to retrieve the
		work order plus all attachments. When the user updates the work
		order, e.g. to mark it completed, they only want to update the
		work order proper, not its attachments. Users may
		add/remove/replace attachments to the work order during its
		lifetime.
