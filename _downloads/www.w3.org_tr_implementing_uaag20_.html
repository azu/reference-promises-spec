<p>This document provides supporting information for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> for designing <a class="dfn-instance"
href="#def-user-agent" rel="glossary" title="definition: User agent">user
agents</a> that lower barriers to Web accessibility for people with
disabilities. User agents include  browsers, media players and  applications that
retrieve and render <a class="dfn-instance" href="#def-content"
rel="glossary" title="definition: Content">Web content</a>. A user agent that
<a href="#conformance">conforms</a> to these guidelines will promote
accessibility through its own user interface and its ability to communicate with other technologies
(especially <a class="dfn-instance" href="#def-assistive-technology"
rel="glossary" title="definition: Assistive technology">assistive
technologies</a>). All users, not just users with disabilities,
should find conforming user agents to be more usable. In addition to helping developers of browsers and media players, this
document will also benefit developers of assistive technologies because it
explains what types of information and control an assistive technology may
expect from a conforming user agent. </p>
<p>This document provides explanation of the intent of  UAAG 2.0 success criteria, examples of implementation of the guidelines, best practice recommendations and additional resources for the guideline. </p>
<p>The "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0" (<acronym
title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">UAAG</acronym> 2.0) is part
of a series of accessibility guidelines published by the <acronym

<h3><a name="status-status" id="status-status"></a>Working Draft of Implementing UAAG  2.0</h3>
<p>This is the W3C Working Draft of 7 November 2013. This working draft is updated from comments received on the 23 May 2013 Working Draft. </p>
<p><a name="status-changes-Imp" id="status-changes2"></a>Substantial changes in this draft include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#sc_111-e">1.1.1 Render Alternative Content</a> Added an example of &lt;abbr&gt; alternative  content and moved the intent and examples from 2.11.8 to 1.1.1 when it was agreed that 2.11.8 was a subset of 1.1.1. </li>
  <li><a href="#sc_121-e">1.2.1 Support Repair by Assistive Technologies: </a> Changed the intent and added a new example to provide a clearer example of the desired behavior. . </li>
  <li><a href="#sc_235">2.3.5 Customize Keyboard Commands</a> added language to the intent that the customizations should be saved as required in <a href="#sc_271">2.7.1 Allow Persistent Accessibility Settings</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="status-feedback" id="status-feedback2"></a>The Working Group seeks feedback on  the following points for this draft: . </p>
<ul>
  <li>What accessibility needs specific to mobile web application user   interfaces have  not been addressed that should be addressed by UAAG   2.0? </li>
  <li>Are there sufficient examples of other technologies that support   accessibility, e.g. WAI-ARIA, HTML5 Canvas, IndieUI?</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments on this draft should be sent to <a href="mailto:public-uaag2-comments@w3.org">public-uaag2-comments@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-uaag2-comments/">Public      Archive</a>) <strong>by 16 December 2013</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> (UAWG) expects to advance <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">UAAG 2.0</a> through the W3C Recommendation track with Implementing UAAG as a supporting Note. Until  that time <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/">User Agent Accessibility  Guidelines 1.0</a> (UAAG 1.0) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-IMPLEMENTING-UAAG20-20130523/#ref-UAAG10" title="reference: UAAG10">[UAAG10]</a> is the stable,  referenceable version. This Working Draft does not supersede UAAG 1.0. </p>

<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<div class="techs-only">
<p>This document &ndash;  Implementing UAAG 2.0 &ndash; is a companion document to  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-UAAG20-20131107/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)  2.0</a>.</p>
<p>UAAG 2.0  provides three layers of guidance for lowering barriers to accessibility: overall principles, general guidelines, and testable success criteria. The principles, guidelines and success criteria are <a class="dfn-instance" href="#def-normative"
title="definition: Normative">normative</a>, meaning user agent developers are required to follow them to claim conformance to UAAG 2.0.</p>
<p>Implementing  UAAG 2.0  is <a class="dfn-instance" title="definition: informative" href="#def-informative">informative</a>. It provides more detail for each success criterion, including explanatory intent, examples of how the criterion may apply in different user situations, and links to resources. It also contains more detail on levels of conformance, the definition of user agent, the relationship between UAAG 2.0 and with WCAG 2.0 requirements, and the role of user agents and web authoring. </p>
</div>

<div>
<h3><a name="intro-conf-levels" id="intro-conf-levels"></a>Levels of
  Conformance</h3>

<p>User agents  may  conform to UAAG 2.0 at one of three conformance
levels: levels A (basic), AA (recommended), and AAA (advanced). These levels provide a path for user agent   developers to improve their product over time and to prioritize new   ways to improve accessibility. <span class="techs-only">The three levels of UAAG 2.0 conformance are based on the corresponding level designations (A, AA, or AAA) of the individual success criteria (i.e., specific requirements). The user agent can conform to a   level by meeting the success criteria of that level and the levels below   it. </span> </p>
<p> UAAG 2.0 has many options that can be managed through preference settings. Having too many  options may be    overwhelming for some users.  The levels can  help user agent   developers  decide  which options to provide in a basic   user interface, and which to provide through progressive disclosure to   advanced users.</p>

</div>
<div class="techs-only">
<ul>
  <li>Level A conformance: The user agent complies with all applicable level A success criteria.  </li>
  <li>Level AA conformance: The user agent complies with all applicable level A and AA success criteria  </li>
  <li>Level AAA conformance: The user agent complies with all applicable level A, AA, and AAA success   criteria.    </li>
</ul>
<p>Factors that were considered in the process of determining the level to a   success criterion include:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>severity of impact to the user</li>
  <li>inconvenience to other groups of users, including those with other disabilities</li>
  <li>how common implementations are today</li>
  <li>difficulty of implementation</li>
  <li>size of scope</li>
  </ul>
<p>The level designations of the individual success criteria  balance the needs of people with  disabilities with the difficulty the user agent developer could  experience in meeting that need. There are many different types of  disabilities and different types of user agents, so the UAAG level  assigned to a success criterion may not precisely match the definition  of the level in all circumstances. To avoid over-complication, the  various combinations of factors were separated into 3 levels:    </p>
<p>Level A success criteria address needs where  (a) groups of people with   disabilities  are blocked from information or accomplishing a task,   and/or (b) provide solutions that are relatively minor for developers to   implement or are common in the marketplace.    </p>
<p>Level AA success criteria address needs where (a) groups of people with   disabilities have difficulty accessing information or accomplishing a   task (including tasks causing excessive fatigue) and/or (b) the   solutions may be more difficult to implement.    </p>
<p>Level AAA success criteria address needs where (a) the solution improves   accessibility or reduces fatigue for specific groups of people with   disabilities and/or (b) the solution is very difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Even user agents that conform at the highest level (AAA) may
not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of
disability. </p>

<h3><a id="intro-def-ua" name="intro-def-ua">Definition of <dfn>User Agent
</dfn></a></h3>

<p>A user agent is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end-user interaction with web content. See the Glossary definition of <a href="#def-user-agent">user agent</a> for details. </p>
<p>The classic user agent is a browser. A media player, which only performs these functions for time-based media, is also user agent. Web applications and some mobile apps that render web content are also user agents. </p>
<p> For information on authoring tool features included in user agents: see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-IMPLEMENTING-UAAG20-20131107/#intro-atag">Relationship to the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a>.

  <h3><a name="intro-atag" id="intro-atag"></a>Relationship to the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</h3>
<p>While it is common to think of user agents retrieving and rendering web content for one group of people (end-users) that was previously authored by another group (authors), user agents are also frequently involved with the process of authoring content.</p>
<p>
For these cases, it is important for user agent developers to consider the application of another W3C-WAI Recommendation, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</a>. ATAG (currently 2.0 is in draft) provides guidance to the developers of tools regarding the accessibility of authoring interfaces to authors (ATAG 2.0 Part A) and ways in which all authors can be supported in producing accessible web content (ATAG 2.0 Part B).
</p>
<p>For more information on the role of user agents in web authoring see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-IMPLEMENTING-UAAG20-20131107/#intro-atag-role">Implementing UAAG 2.0</a></p>

<h3><a name="intro-wcag" id="intro-wcag"></a>Relationship to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</h3>
<p>The W3C recommendation, <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG</a>), applies to all web content; UAAG provides additional advice on the application user interface. </p>
<p>Some user agents are used to package web content into non-web-based applications, especially on mobile platforms. If the finished application is used to retrieve, render, and facilitate end-user interaction with web content of the end-users choosing, then the application should be considered a stand-alone user agent. If the finished application only renders a constrained set of content specified by the developer, then the application might not be considered a user agent. In both cases, the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines apply to the web content. If the application is not a user agent,   application developers are not responsible for    UAAG 2.0 requirements that extend beyond WCAG 2.0 requirements.

<h3><a name="intro-atag-role" id="intro-atag-role"></a>The Role of User Agents in Web Authoring</h3>
<p>The following is a list of several ways in which user agents are commonly involved in web content authoring and the relationship between UAAG 2.0 and ATAG 2.0. </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Preview tool</strong>: Authors  often preview their work in user agents to test how the content will be appear and operate. ATAG 2.0 includes a special exception when previews are implemented with pre-existing user agents, so there are no additional requirements on user agent developers in this case.</li>

<li><strong>Checking tool</strong>: Authors often make use of user agent error panels (e.g. HTML validity, JavaScript errors) during authoring. ATAG 2.0 Part A applies, but may not include  additional accessibility requirements beyond the UAAG 2.0 success criteria. If a user agent includes an "accessibility checker",  the developer should consult checker implementation guidance in ATAG 2.0 Part B.</li>

<li><strong>Edit modes</strong>: Some user agents include a mode where the user can edit and save changes to the web content, modifying the experience of other users. In this mode, the user agent is acting as an authoring tool and all of ATAG 2.0  applies. </li>

<li><strong>Automatic content changes</strong>: Some user agents or plug-ins may automatically change  retrieved web content before it's rendered. This functionality is not considered an authoring tool because  changes are made to the user's own experience, not the experience of other users. </li>

<li><strong>Providing a platform for web-based authoring tools</strong>: Many web applications serve as authoring tools and make use of user agent features to deliver  functionality (e.g. undo text entry, adjust font size of the authoring tool user interface etc.)
User agent developers should consult ATAG 2.0 to understand the ways in which web-based authoring tools can depend on user agent features. </li>

<ol>
  <li><strong class="handle">Recognized Content Only: </strong>UAAG 2.0 success criteria only apply to web content and its behaviors that can be <a class="dfn-instance"
href="#def-recognize" rel="glossary" title="definition: recognize">recognized</a> by user agents.</li>
  <li> <strong class="handle">Optional Settings:</strong> Throughout UAAG 2.0, all required behaviors may be      provided as optional preference settings unless a success      criterion explicitly says otherwise. For example, if a success      criteria requires high contrast between foreground text and its      background, the user agent may also provide choices      with low contrast. A required behavior does not need to be the      default option unless the success criteria explicitly says      otherwise.</li>
  <li><strong class="handle">RFC 2119 language not used: </strong>UAAG 2.0 does not use RFC 2119 language (must, may, should) because these are guidelines and not  interoperable specifications. These words in UAAG 2.0 don't have the same sense as they do in RFC 2119. </li>
  <li><strong class="handle">Simultaneous satisfaction of success criteria: </strong>Users can access  all behaviors required by UAAG 2.0 at the same time (e.g. when the user resizes the viewport per 1.8.9, content is reflowed per 1.8.6), except where those behaviors are mutually exclusive.</li>

        <p>Users with some disabilities may find a specific content element causes them physical pain (e.g. an image with high contrast) or distress (e.g. an image that triggers post traumatic stress disorder), or that the element's size may make the page difficult to use (because of difficulty scrolling, or shifting gaze, or moving the pointer more than a certain distance). In these cases the user needs to be able to hide that element or replace it with alternative content or a placeholder. Other users may find specific elements are simply unusable (e.g. an image   that is too low contrast for the user's vision). In these cases the user needs to be able to access author-provided alternative content (e.g. Alt text or Longdesc) or the very minimum a placeholder (e.g. filename). </p>
        <p>Some users with disabilities need  alternate languages or audio tracks   (e.g. descriptive video). Users need the ability to choose  tracks that   best meet their accessibility needs (e.g. the caption track in their   own language) when authors have provided many alternatives.</p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> If the user cannot directly select or choose the element in order to perform commands upon it (e.g. if the browser does not support clicking on HTML background images or moving focus to them with the keyboard), the user agent must provide an alternative user interface for this feature.</p>

He can hide foreground images by right-clicking on them or pressing the Tab key to move focus to them, and then choosing a command from the element's context menu. However, the browser does not let him right-click or navigate to the background image. Therefore it provides a user preference setting to hide all background images or to hide the background image on the current site.</li>

She's a paralegal and often has to search long documents for terms that are rendered as acronyms. It's often easier for her to speak full terms into the search box rather than acronyms because full terms are easier to say and better recognized, and this allows her to keep her vocabulary less cluttered by acronyms that may increase misrecognitions. She chooses a setting on her browser that automatically expands all acronyms and abbreviations before she does a search.</li>
              <li class="unclassified-ex">Laura has impaired vision and uses the shapes of words to help her recognize them easily.

  <p>Users need to be able to easily discover when authors have provided alternative web content that may be of interest  so  they can  decide whether to have it rendered (see <a href="#sc_111">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a>). While the type of indicator is not prescribed, the success criterion  requires that the indicator be placed along with the rendered content that has the alternative. This rules out indicators such as in the status bar, that don't clearly identify which content within a document has the alternative.  Suitable indicators include outlines, adjacent icons, and adjacent links. As with any other feature of the user agent, the indicator itself must be accessible (e.g.  keyboard accessible, alternative text, zoomable). </p>

Therefore it's important that assistive technology have access to as much information as possible about the non-text content that needs repair, and also to be able to inform the user that no author-provided text alternative is available. User agents should provide assistive technology with  available metadata for the non-text content that needs repair, but not substitute repair text in ways assistive technology will mistake  for author-provided text alternatives.       </p>

         <p>Users need to be able to easily discover web content they can interact with. One effective way to do this is to highlight enabled elements and links (including recently visited links). Highlighted selection and content focus lets people who use keyboard, gesture and speech input  know where they are working. On some pages controls may be difficult to discern amid a large amount of other content, or may be styled so the controls are difficult to distinguish from other content. This can be particularly difficult for people with visual impairments, who may not be able to  distinguish subtle visual differences. People with some cognitive impairments may have difficulty distinguishing between items with similar or non-standard appearance. Visually distinguishing these items reduces the amount of time or number of commands these groups require to examine a page. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Note 1: </em>In addition to these required categories, it is recommended that user agents also allow the user to highlight the active viewport, even when it is a frame or similar within the active window. This makes it much easier for the user to visually locate the active focus.</li>
            <li><em>Note 2: </em>Platform
            conventions will dictate whether or not keyboard focus in an inactive viewport is visually indicated by an inactive cursor.</li>
            <li><em>Note 3: </em>the definition of visited and unvisited links is up to the user agent. Visited links may be links visited during the current session or in the browser's history. </li>

          <p>Users with some types of disabilities have difficulty reading  text as the author has formatted it. For example, some users  with low vision, dyslexia, and related conditions and   situations cannot read author-formatted text. However, they can read   text that has a  format customized to their individual needs (e.g. larger letters,   different font,  more spacing). Users with some cognitive disabilities and those who need to reduce the number of commands they enter to scroll through a document, may need to fit more information on the screen (e.g. smaller letters or spacing). Users need  to access a wide range of 
            font sizes, styles, colors, and other attributes in order to find the 
            combination that works best for their  needs. In providing  preferences, it is important to avoid making assumptions. For example, 
            some users may increase font size to make text more legible, while 
            other users may reduce the font size to decrease the need to scroll the content. </p>
          <p>The relative size of text provides visual cues that help in understanding and navigating web content. Some content may be authored in a way that  makes it difficult or impossible to understand when  font distinctions are hidden, such as headlines that are in not in a larger font than body text.  It's important that users who need to enlarge or reduce text size be able to preserve these visual cues.</p>

    <p>Users who need large amount of screen magnification need to control the appearance of types of elements. For instance, a magnification of 300% can make headlines too large for display. Users need to be able to set the characteristics of element types (e.g. heading 1, heading 2, table heading) to make the web content readable. Magnification users who find that text size distinction greatly increases scrolling and fatigue also need to  be able to display important elements such as headings (including table headings) and input fields independently from global settings.       </p>

          <p>Many users with low vision have difficulty reading italic and underline and must be able to globally remove these styles.

        <p>Some users  need to turn off underline, italic and bold because they can  be hard to read. Bold characters can &quot;bleed&quot; when characters are too close together which reduces readibility for some. Users who are changing font size need to be able to change margin size to ensure  efficient use of screen space.  Sometimes when font sizes are increased proportionally,   too much white space appears. When borders appear too close to text, it can become difficult for some users to  discriminate the text letter shape, so those users need a way to  turn borders off. At the same time, increasing the weight of the visible border  around  an input field makes it more visible, so users need control of the visible characteristics of the borders, for example border color, weight and spacing.  </p>
        <p>User stylesheets can be used where available. Users can control characteristics by element type, so that, for example, headings at the same level will have a similar appearance. </p>

To make web pages readable, Wade uses a user stylesheet to change the way the headings are displayed. He makes the headings a little smaller than the main text, changes the font to Arial and red,  adds space before and after the headings, and adds border above the headings. This ensures that  headings aren't too big,  navigation links don't break across lines as much, and a reasonable amount of text is visible at a time, so Wade doesn't have to do extra scrolling.

        <p>Advanced features that improve readibility include more granular control of line spacing, override of capitalization and auto-hyphenation, and control of margins and borders. Some users need to turn off capitalization because words that are in all caps can be hard to read. This should not be interpreted as a requirement to provide heuristics to interpret text that has been entered in all caps into appropriate mixed case. The intent is that if all caps has been controlled by a style, the user can override that style. </p>
        <p>Wide margins around blocks of text help users focus on the  text and not get distracted by surrounding text and images. Some users with low vision prefer to use borders  (including border line color, width, style) to indicate headings, rather than making headings  larger than the main text. </p>

        <p>Stylesheets provide for powerful customization of rendered content. Occasionally a user may need to make  slight modifications to the author-supplied external stylesheets used on a website to satisfy certain accessibility needs. At other times a web author may have created a stylesheet that a user with a disability finds helpful. The intent of this success criteria is to allow users to easily save the CSS for a website and make needed modifications without having to create full stylesheet of their own and to apply well designed stylesheets to other web pages where they find the stylesheets helpful.</p>

<p class="summary" id="summary18"><strong>Summary</strong>:  The user agent provides programmatic and visual cues to keep 
the user oriented. These include highlighting the viewport (1.8.1, Level 
A) and customizing the highlighting attributes (1.8.8, Level AA), keeping the focus within the viewport (1.8.2 &amp; 1.8.6, Level A), 
resizing the viewport (1.8.9, Level A), providing scrollbars that 
identify when content is outside the visible region (1.8.3, Level A) and 
which portion is visible (1.8.4, Level A), changing the size of 
graphical content with zoom (1.8.5, Level A &amp; 1.8.7, Level A), and 
restoring the focus and point of regard when the user returns to a 
previously viewed page (1.8.10, Level AA). The user can specify that all 
viewports have the same user interface elements (1.8.13, Level AA), if 
and how new viewports open (1.8.11, Level AA), and whether the new 
viewport automatically gets focus (1.8.12, Level AA). The user can mark 
items in a webpage and use shortcuts to navigate back to marked items.

        <p>A user has many ways to input information into a computer or device, including mouse, keyboard, gesture, and speech. The keyboard paradigm is the most universal interface for text input &ndash; even devices that do not have a keyboard (like mobile phones) support a software interface for them. A user should be able to navigate, read and use all of the web page or application without needing to use a mouse. Some users do not use a mouse. Others can only use a pointing device that uses the keyboard API. It's important that these users be able to interact with enabled components, select content, navigate viewports, configure the user agent, access documentation, install the user agent, and operate user interface controls, all entirely through keyboard input. User agents generally support at least three types of keyboard operation:
        </p>
        <ol>
     <li>Direct (e.g. keyboard shortcuts such a "F1" to open the help menu; see checkpoint 11.4 for single-key access requirements)</li>
   <li>Sequential (e.g. navigation through cascading menus)</li>
   <li>Spatial (e.g. when the keyboard is used to move the pointing device in two-dimensional visual space to manipulate a bitmap image)</li></ol>
        <p>User agents should support  direct or sequential keyboard operation for all functionalities. The user agent should offer a combination of keyboard-operable user interface controls (e.g. keyboard operable print menus and settings) and direct keyboard shortcuts (e.g. to print the current page).</p>

          <p>People do not expect side effects when moving the keyboard focus regardless of whether the side effect is caused by the user agent or author content. If users fail to notice side effects, they could end up doing something disastrous. This is especially likely for users of assistive technology who cannot see changes happening elsewhere on the screen. Users may also find it confusing or disorienting if the effect causes unexpected focus movement or changes in context. If the user agent does implement side effects to keyboard navigation, it is recommended that it provide a user preference setting to disable them. However, in some cases it may be more appropriate to provide a separate navigation mechanism that avoids side effects, such as allowing the user to hold down the Ctrl key while navigating to avoid changing selection or choice.
            Note: It may not be possible for the user agent to detect or prevent side effects implemented by scripts in the content, but the user agent is required to prevent side effects that are under its control.<br />

Fortunately, the platform also has a convention that holding down the Ctrl key while navigating that  moves the focus without changing selection or option choice. Murray uses this while exploring.

Users need to have a mental map of where the focus will land when they press the Tab key or use other sequential navigation commands. If the focus jumps in seemingly random fashion, skipping up or down, it becomes impossible to use this method efficiently because   users must stop, find the focus, reorient, and determine what direction they should proceed every  time they press navigation keys. This is a particular problem for users with some cognitive limitations or whose disability makes input difficult, tiring, or painful.

        <p>People using a keyboard interface need the ability to remap the user agent's keyboard shortcuts in order to avoid keystroke conflicts with assistive technology, reduce number of keystrokes, use familiar keystroke combinations, and optimize keyboard layout (e.g. for one-handed use). This is important for people with dexterity issues where every keystroke can be time consuming, tiring or painful. It is also important for people using assistive technologies such as screen readers, where many keystrokes are already in use by the assistive technology. The goal of this success criterion is to enable the user to be in control of what happens when a given key is pressed, use the keyboard commands that meet specific needs, and save the modifications.</p>
        <p>Content authors can use the Accesskey attribute to define shortcut keys that allow quick access to specific elements, actions, or parts of the web content. The author can select shortcuts that are different from what the user expects. Users who rely upon keyboard input may want consistent shortcut keys across the sites they visit. </p>
        <p>Users should have the option to make any keyboard shortcuts  be persistent across browsing sessions. The user should be able to save, import and export these settings.</p>
        <p>User agents can also offer the user the option to automatically apply preferred key combinations for content that has author-specified accesskey bindings that are based on the associated text, label, or ARIA role. This overrides any author-specified keybinding. </p>

              <li class="unclassified-ex">Frank has repetitive strain injuries and uses speech input.  He has defined standard commands to access commonly used parts of a website. For example, when Frank says &quot;site search&quot;, the cursor  jumps to the search field. If the author has assigned an access key that is not standard, Frank can override it and set the access key to a standard mapping so he can say the same search command across all the sites he uses. </li>
              <li class="unclassified-ex">Laura types with one hand and finds keys on the left side of the
                keyboard easier to press. She browses to a web page and notices that
                the author has assigned access keys using keys from the right side of
                the keyboard. She opens a dialog in the user agent and reassigns the
                access keys from the web page to the left side of the keyboard. She also uses the user agent's preference settings to redefine its keyboard shortcuts in the same way. </li>
              <li class="mobile-ex">Laura types with one hand. On her  mobile device, Laura  maps common website actions to numeric shortcut keys. For example, she prefers to have the 1 key to activate a site's search function. An author of a site visited daily by this user defines &quot;S&quot; as the accesskey for the search function. Laura overrides the author-specified accesskey of &quot;S&quot; with &quot;1&quot;. </li>
              <li class="unclassified-ex">Elaine has low vision and is using a screen magnification program. The program uses Alt+M to increase the
size of the magnified area of the screen. She notices that in her web
browser, Alt+M is a access key for activating a home button that stops her
from being able to control her magnification software. She opens a
access key reassignment feature in the user agent, and sets Alt+O to be
the new access key for the home button. Her screen magnification software
now works correctly.</li>
              <li class="unclassified-ex">George uses a screenreader. The screenreader uses Ctrl+F to read the item with focus.  Since this is a common user agent command for Find, the user agent    allows George to reassign the Find command to a non-conflicting   key binding.  The user agent    provides a list of user interface features and default keyboard   assignments with options for the George to assign new key combinations.    George saves the user keyboard customizations the same way he saves other user preferences.</li>

        <p>Users with disabilities may not be able to use a user agent in a particular configuration. This can occur during setup when default settings don't meet their needs, or after someone changes an option. If users  cannot  change the settings from the user interface, they need a way to adjust or reset those options from outside the user agent. The user agent can accomplish this in multiple ways including detecting and implementing the platform accessibility settings, providing an external file to modify, providing access to settings from a separate utility program, providing accessibility options in the installation program, or providing command-line switches to change the user agent's behavior. </p>
        <p><em>Note: </em>User agents are encouraged to allow all user preferences to be adjusted. </p>

            <p>This can reduce keystrokes, bring buttons into view that are hidden by default or otherwise allow the user to interact with the user agent in a more efficient fashion.

Similarly, users with low vision may have to  move their magnified view-port excessively to see frequently used controls.

        <p>Seizures due to photosensitivity can occur when there is a rapid series of general flashing, or a red flash. People who are particularly sensitive to flashing can be harmed by any level of flashing. 2.10.2 has the same effect as 2.10.1, going further to ensure that more sensitive users can traverse the web without potentially harmful effects.</p>

        <p>Users who
          need to avoid signals that may trigger seizures, users who are easily
          distracted, and users who have difficulty interacting with the
          controls provided for playing media need to be able to load media in a paused state. The user agent provides a global control that
          sets a state equivalent to "paused waiting for user interaction" for
          all recognized media when a page loads. The user has a global option to set  autoplay to off or paused until the
          user activates &quot;play&quot;. The user agent provides a visual
          or auditory indicator that the video is in paused
          state and needs user interaction to start. This prevents media from
          playing without explicit request from the user.</p>
        <p>When the media is not in the actual document, but rather has
          been created with document.createElement('audio'),  the
          user agent does not recognize that the media exists and cannot give a visual indication by default. In this case, it
          is up to the author to provide the controls. See WCAG in resources
          below. </p>

        <p>Users need to know that navigation in a web page is going to start in a predictable location and move in a predictable fashion. If a page moves the initial focus to somewhere other than the beginning of the page, the user may skip over  content without realizing it. If the focus moves and remains unnoticed, users can make  unintentional changes, such as entering data in an incorrect field. Focus changes can cause a window to scroll unexpectedly, confusing users. This is particularly problematic for users who can only see a small portion of the document, because they must use more effort to determine where the cursor has moved. Such users also are more likely to continue typing, not immediately realizing that the context has changed. Users who find navigation time consuming, tiring, or painful (including those using screen readers or with impaired dexterity) may also need more steps to return to the area where they want to work. It may improve accessibility for some users on some pages to have the page  set focus to specific links or fields when the page loads, but this can  be detrimental for other users, and therefore users need to  control this behavior. </p>

          <p>Platform accessibility services  provide common functionality across  the well-behaved applications running on the platform. This reduces exceptions that assistive technology has to implement for the hundreds of applications it may need to support. Most major operating environments provide platform accessibility services that allow applications to work with assistive technologies. These platform accessibility services must be supported by both the user agent and the assistive technology. Specifics of what constitutes a platform accessibility service will differ on each platform, but basic features common to these services are addressed by other success criteria under Guideline 4.1.</p>
          <p>Most web-based user agents  support this requirement automatically because they run inside host user agents. The host is responsible for exposing all content, including nested user agents, via platform accessibility services. As long as the nested user agent's user interface is entirely web-based and complies with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (e.g. providing alternative text and supporting WAI-ARIA where needed) the host will understand it well enough to provide a bridge between the content and platform accessibility services. </p>

          <p>Modern web content is highly interactive. Including people who use assistive technology in the interactive experience requires that the user agent  provide  information about user interface components in a standardized manner.This information includes: </p>
          <ul><li>Name (component name)</li>
          <li>Role (purpose, such as alert, button, checkbox)</li>
          <li>State (current status, such as busy, disabled, hidden)</li>

          <li>Selection (selected, selectable)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Every component developed for the user agent must pass this information to the appropriate accessibility platform architecture or application program interface (API). Embedded user agents, like media players can pass Name, Role, State, and Value   via the WAI-ARIA techniques.  Since not every element supports every property, follow the platform accessibility services convention for cases where an element type does not support one of the listed properties. <br />

Alternately, they may elect to save that content to   disk and launch it in a third-party application.

<h2><a name="conformance" id="conformance"></a>Conformance</h2>

<p>This section is normative.</p>
<p>Conformance means that the user agent satisfies the success criteria 
defined in the guidelines section. This section lists requirements for conformance and conformance claims.</p>
<h3><a name="conformance-require" id="conformance-require"></a>Conformance Requirements  </h3>
<p>  In order for a web page to conform to UAAG 2.0, one of the following levels of conformance is met 
in full.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Level A: For level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the 
  user agent satisfies all the Level A success criteria.</li>
  <li>Level AA: For level AA conformance, the user agent satisfies all  
  level A and level AA Success Criteria.</li>
  <li>Level AAA: For level AAA conformance, the user agent satisfies all  
  level A, level AA and level AAA Success Criteria.</li>
</ul> 
<p>  Note: Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, 
  developers are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward 
  meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of 
  conformance. </p>
 <h3><a name="conformance-claims" id="conformance-claims"></a>Conformance Claims</h3>
<p>User agents can conform to UAAG 2.0 without making a claim. If a   conformance claim is made, the conformance claim must meet the following   conditions and include the following information:</p>
<h4><a name="conformance-conditions" id="conformance-conditions"></a>Conditions on Conformance Claims</h4>
<p>If a conformance claim is made, the conformance claim must meet the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least one version of the conformance claim must be published on the 
web as a document meeting level "A" of WCAG 2.0. A suggested metadata 
description for this document is "UAAG 2.0 Conformance Claim".</li>
<li>Whenever the claimed conformance level is published (e.g. product 
information website), the URI for the on-line published version of the 
conformance claim must be included. </li>
<li>The existence of a conformance claim does not imply that the W3C has 
reviewed the claim or assured its validity. </li>
<li>There are no restrictions on who can make a claim. </li>
<li>Claimants are solely responsible for the accuracy of their claims. </li>
<li>Claimants are encouraged to claim conformance to the most recent version 
of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Recommendation. </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="conformance-req-components" id="conformance-req-components"></a>Components of  UAAG 2.0 Conformance Claims</h4>
<ol>
<li>Claimant name and affiliation</li>
<li>Claimant contact information</li>
<li>Date of the claim</li>
<li>Conformance level satisfied</li>
<li><strong>User agent information</strong>:
<ol type="a">
    <li>Name and manufacturer</li>
    <li>Version number or version range</li>
    <li>Required patches or updates, human language of the user interface and documentation</li>
    <li>Configuration changes to the user agent that are needed to meet the success criteria   (e.g. ignore author foreground/background color, turn on Carat Browsing)</li>
    <li>Plugins or extensions (including version numbers)  needed to meet the success criteria (e.g. mouseless browsing)</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Provide relevant information about the software and/or hardware platform(s) that the user agent relies on for conformance. This information may include:
<ol type="a">
    <li>Name and manufacturer</li>
    <li>Version of key software components (e.g. operating system, other software environment)</li>
    <li>Hardware requirements (e.g. audio output enabled, minimum screen size: 2&quot;, bluetooth keyboard attached)</li>
    <li>Operating system(s) (e.g. Windows, Android, iOS, GNOME)</li>
    <li>Other software environment (Java, Eclipse)      </li>
    <li>Host web browser when the conforming user agent is web-based (e.g. JW Player  on Firefox)</li>
    <li>Configuration changes to the platform that are needed to meet the success criteria (e.g. turn on Sticky Keys, use High Contrast Mode)</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li> <strong>Platform Limitations:</strong> If the platform (hardware or operating system) does not support a capability necessary for a given UAAG 2.0 success criterion, list the success criterion and the feature (e.g. a mobile operating system does not support platform accessibility services, therefore the user agent cannot meet success criterion 4.1.2). For these listed technologies, the user agent can claim that the success criteria do not apply. </li>
<li><strong>Web Content Technologies:</strong> List the web content technologies rendered by the user agent that are included in the claim. If there are any web content technologies rendered by the user agent that are excluded from the conformance claim, list these separately. Examples of web content technologies include web markup languages such HTML, XML, CSS, SVG, and MathML, image formats such as PNG, JPG and GIF, scripting languages such as JavaScript/EcmaScript, specific video codecs, and proprietary document formats. </li>
<li><strong>Declarations:</strong> For each success criterion, provide a declaration of either
  <ol type="a">
    <li>whether or not the success criterion has been 
      satisfied; or </li>
    <li>declaration that the success criterion is not applicable and a 
      rationale for why not</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="conformance-limited" id="conformance-limited"></a>Limited Conformance for Extensions</h4>
<p> This option may be used for a user agent extension or plug-in with limited functionality that wishes to claim UAAG 2.0 conformance. An extension or plugin can claim conformance for a specific success criterion or a narrow range of success criteria as stated in the claim. All other success criteria may be denoted as Not Applicable. The add-in must not cause the combined user agent (hosting user agent plus installed extension or plug-in) to fail any success criteria that the hosting user agent would otherwise pass.</p>

may not be obvious. </p>
<h3><a name="conformance-disclaimer" id="conformance-disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Neither W3C, WAI, nor UAWG take any responsibility for any aspect or 
result of any UAAG 2.0 conformance claim that has not been published 
under the authority of the W3C, WAI, or UAWG. </p>

  <dd><a href="#def-content">Web content</a> that  user agents can programmatically determine is usable in
place of other content that some people are not able to access. Alternative
content fulfills essentially the same function or purpose as the original
content. There are several general types of alternative content:

    <ul>
      <li><dfn><a id="def-Text-Alternatives" name="def-Text-Alternatives"></a>text alternative for non-text content</dfn>: Text that is programmatically associated with <a href="#def-non-text-content">non-text content</a> or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. For example, an image of a chart might
have two text alternatives: a short text alternative and a described-by
relationship to a nearby paragraph that more fully describes the content of
the chart.</li>
      <li><dfn><a id="def-Time-Based-Alternatives" name="def-Time-Based-Alternatives"></a>alternative for time-based media</dfn>: <a href="#def-content">Web content</a> that serves 
        the same function or purpose as one or more tracks in a time-based media presentation. This includes alternatives for audio such as <a href="#def-captions">captions</a> and sign language interpretation, 
        and alternatives for video such as 
        <a href="#def-audio-description">audio descriptions</a> and <a href="#def-Auditory-Description-Extended"> extended audio descriptions</a>.   Another form of time-based media
alternative is a correctly sequenced text description of time-based visual and
auditory information that also is capable of achieving the outcomes of any
interactivity in the time-based presentation.</li>
      <li><dfn><a id="def-text-alternatives-for-text" name="def-text-alternatives-for-text"></a>text alternatives for text content</dfn>: Text that is programmatically associated
with certain types of text content to provide expanded information. For
example, an abbreviation (or acronym) may provide an expansion of the
shortened word or initialized words 
         (&lt;abbr title=&quot;User Agent Accessibility  Guidelines&quot;&gt;UAAG&lt;/abbr&gt;). </li>
      <li><dfn><a id="def-Media-Alternatives" name="def-Media-Alternatives"></a>media alternative for text</dfn>: Media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives). A media alternative for text is provided for people who benefit from alternate representations of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language video), or audio-video.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <span class="glossary-note">Note</span>: According to WCAG 2.0, alternative content may or may not be
programmatically determinable (e.g., a short description for an image might
appear in the image's description attribute or within text near the image).
However, UAAG 2.0 adds the <a href="#def-programmatically-avail">programmatically available</a> condition
because this is the only type of alternative content that user agents can
recognize. </dd>

  <dd class="glossary">For the purpose of UAAG 2.0 conformance, assistive
    technology meets the following  criteria:
    <ol>
      <li>Relies on services (such as retrieving <a class="dfn-instance"
          href="#def-web-resource" title="definition: Web resource">web
        resources</a> and parsing markup) provided by one or more

      <li>Provides services beyond those offered by the host user agents to
        meet the requirements of users with disabilities. Additional
        services include alternative renderings (e.g. as synthesized
        speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g.
        voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and
        content transformations (e.g. to make tables more accessible).</li>
    </ol>
    Examples of assistive technologies that are important in the context
    of UAAG 2.0 include the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Screen magnifiers, which are used by people with visual
      disabilities to enlarge and change colors on the screen to improve
      the visual readability of rendered text and images.</li>
    <li>Screen readers, which are used by people who are blind or have
      reading disabilities to read textual information through
      synthesized speech or braille displays.</li>
    <li>Voice recognition software, which is used by some people who have
      physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard and mouse.</li>
    <li>Alternative keyboards, which are used by some people with 
      physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard and mouse.</li>

  <dd class="glossary">The act of time-coordinating two or more presentation components (e.g. a <a href="#def-visual-track">visual track</a> with captions, several tracks in a multimedia presentation). For authors, the requirement to synchronize means to provide the data that will permit sensible time-coordinated rendering by a user agent. For example, web content developers can ensure that the segments of caption text are neither too long nor too short, and that they map to segments of the visual track that are appropriate in length. For user agent developers, the requirement to synchronize means to present the content in a sensible time-coordinated fashion under a wide range of circumstances including technology constraints (e.g. small text-only displays), user limitations (e.g. slow reading speeds, large font sizes, high need for review or repeat functions), and content that is sub-optimal in terms of accessibility.</dd>

  <dd class="glossary">Any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end user interaction with web content. UAAG 2.0 identifies four user agent architectures:
    <ul>
      <li><a name="def-stand-alone" id="def-stand-alone"></a><dfn>platform-based user agent, non-web-based user agent</dfn>: User agents that run on non-web platforms (operating  systems and cross-OS platforms, such as Java) and perform content retrieval,  rendering and end-user interaction facilitation themselves (e.g. Firefox,  Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, Windows Media Player, QuickTime Pro,  RealPlayer). </li>
      <li><a name="def-plug-in"
  id="def-plug-in"></a><a
  name="def-embedded" id="def-embedded"><dfn>embedded user agent, plug-in</dfn></a>: User agents that &quot;plug-in&quot; to other user agents or applications (e.g. media player plug-in for a web browser, web view component). Embedded user agents may establish direct connections with the platform (e.g. communication via platform accessibility services). </li>
      <li><a
  name="def-web-based" id="def-web-based2"><dfn>web-based user agent</dfn></a>: User agents that have user interfaces that  are implemented using web content technologies and are accessed by users via a  user agent. web-based user agents transform content into web content  technologies that the host user agent can render (e.g. Google Docs, Bing  Translator, Yahoo Mail).</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Note:</em> Many web applications retrieve, render and facilitate interaction with very limited data sets (e.g. online ticket booking). In such cases, WCAG 2.0, without UAAG 2.0, may be appropriate for assessing the application's accessibility. <br/>
    Examples of software that are generally considered user agents under UAAG 2.0:
    <ul>
      <li>Desktop web browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera)</li>
      <li>Mobile web browsers (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Android Browser, Opera Mini, Atomic Web, Puffin)</li>
      <li>Browser plug-ins (e.g. QuickTime Plug-in for Firefox, Acrobat Reader Plug-in for Internet Explorer, Shockwave Plug-in for Chrome)</li>
      <li>Web view components (e.g. Webkit Webview component, Web Tools Platform Plug-in for Eclipse, UIWebView for iOS)</li>
      <li>Authoring tools that render the web content being edited (e.g. Word, Dreamweaver, HTML-Kit)</li>
    </ul>
    Examples of software that are not considered user agents under UAAG 2.0 (in all cases, WCAG 2.0 still applies if the software is web-based):
    <ul>
      <li>Operating environments or software bundles that include platform-based user agents (e.g. Windows, OS X, KDE, iOS), though the included user agents themselves are covered by UAAG 2.0.</li>
      <li>General-purpose platforms or toolkits that don't use web technologies, even though they may be used by user agents for other purposes (e.g. GNOME, KDE, .NET Framework/CLR).</li>
      <li>Narrow-purpose platform-based or web applications (e.g. online ticket booking applications).</li>
      <li>Authoring tools that only display a source view of the web content being edited (e.g. Notepad, Vim).</li>

  <dd>Software installed into a <a class="dfn-instance" href="#def-user-agent">user agent</a> that adds one or more additional features that modify the behavior of the user agent. Two common capabilities for user agent extensions are the ability to:
    <ul>

  <dd class="glossary"> A user interface function that lets users interact with web content. UAAG 2.0 recognizes a variety of approaches to presenting the content in a view, including:
    <ul>
      <li><a name="def-rendered-view"
  id="def-rendered-view"><dfn>rendered view</dfn></a>: A view where content is presented such that it is rendered, played or executed. There are two sub-types:
        <ul>
          <li>In conventionally rendered views the content is rendered, played or executed according to the web content technology specification. This is the default view of most user agents.</li>
          <li>In unconventionally rendered views the content is rendered quite differently than specified in the technology specification (e.g. rendering an audio file as a graphical wavefront).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="def-source-view"
  id="def-source-view"><dfn>source view</dfn></a>: A view where  the web content is presented without being rendered, played or executed. The source view may be plain text (i.e. &quot;View Source&quot;) or it may include some other organization (e.g. presenting the markup in a tree).</li>
      <li><a name="def-outline-view"
  id="def-outline-view"><dfn>outline view</dfn></a>: A view where only a subset of the rendered content is presented, usually composed of labels or placeholders for important structural elements. The important structural elements will depend on the web content technology, but may include headings, table captions, and content sections.</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Note: </em>A view can be visual, audio, or tactile.</dd>
  <dt class="glossary"><a name="def-viewport" id="def-viewport"></a><dfn>viewport</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A mechanism for presenting only part of a visual or tactile <a href="#def-view">view</a> to the user via a screen or tactile display. There may be multiple viewports on to the same underlying view (e.g. when a split-screen is used to present the top and bottom of a document simultaneously) and viewports may be nested (e.g. a scrolling frame located within a larger document). When the viewport is smaller than the view it is presenting, some of the view will not be presented. Mechanisms are typically provided to move the view or the viewport such that all of the view can be brought into the viewport  (e.g. scrollbars). </dd>
<dd><span class="glossary-note">Note</span>: In UAAG 1.0 viewports were defined as having a temporal dimension. In UAAG 2.0, this is not the case. Since audio content is inherently time-based, audio viewports are excluded.</dd><dd>
  <ul>
      <li><a name="def-viewport-toplevel" id="def-viewport-toplevel"></a><dfn>top-level viewport</dfn>: A viewport that is not contained within another viewport of a platform-based user agent. Web-based user agents are always displayed inside another viewport, and therefore are never top-level viewports. A popular browser implementation is to provide a window that includes some user agent user interface elements (e.g., menus) and a series of tabbed panels, each of which contains additional user agent user interface elements (e.g., address bar, bookmarks, back/forward buttons) and a top-level viewport for rendering a view of the addressed web resource.</li>

  <dt class="glossary"><a name="viewport-dimension" id="viewport-dimension"></a><dfn>viewport dimensions</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The onscreen size of a <a href="#def-viewport">viewport</a>, or the temporal duration of a viewport displaying time-based media. When the dimensions (spatial or temporal) of
    rendered content exceed the dimensions of the viewport, the user agent
    provides mechanisms such as scroll bars and advance and rewind controls
    so that the user can access the rendered content &quot;outside&quot; the
    viewport (e.g. when the user can only view a portion of a
    large document through a small graphical viewport, or when audio
