The following proposed convention reflects the consensus of a break-out
group at the W3C Distributed Indexing and Searching Workshop, May
28-29, 1996, concerning tagging of meta information in HTML.  This
break out group included representatives of the Dublin Core/Warwick
Framework Metadata meetings, Lycos, Microsoft, WebCrawler, the IEEE
metadata effort, Verity Software, and the W3C. <P>

<H3> 1. THE PROBLEM  </H3>

The problem is to identify a simple means of embedding metadata within
HTML documents without requiring additional tags or changes to browser
software, and without unnecessarily compromising current practices for
robot collection of data. <P>

Given that it is judged undesirable for such embedded metadata to
display on browser screens, any solution requires encoding information
in attribute tags rather than as container element content. <P>

The goal was to agree on a simple convention for encoding structured
metadata information of a variety of types (which may or may not be
registered with a central registry analogous to the Mime Type
registry).  It was judged that a registry may be a necessary feature of
the metadata infrastructure as alternative schema are elaborated, but
that deployment in the short-term could go forward without such a
registry, especially in light of the proposed use of the LINK tag to
link descriptions to a standard schema description as described below.
<P>

<H3>2. A PROPOSED CONVENTION </H3>

The solution agreed upon is to encode schema elements in META tags, one
element per META tag, and as many META tags as are necessary.  Grouping
of schema elements is achieved by a prefix schema identifier associated
with each schema element.    <P>

The convention agreed upon is as follows:<P>
<PRE>

     &lt META NAME    = "<EM>schema_identifier.element_name</EM>"
            CONTENT = "<EM>string data</EM>"  &gt
</PRE>

Thus, a partial Dublin Core citation might be encoded as follows:<P>
<PRE>

     &lt META NAME    = "DC.title"
            CONTENT = "HTML 2.0 Specification" &gt
        
     &lt META NAME    = "DC.author"
            CONTENT = "Tim Berners-Lee" &gt
            
     &lt META NAME    = "DC.author"
            CONTENT = "Dan Connolly" &gt 
           
     &lt META NAME    = "DC.date"
            CONTENT = "November, 1995" &gt
                     
     &lt META NAME    = "DC.identifier"
            CONTENT = "ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1866.txt" &gt
</PRE>
        
And a collection of Microsoft Word metadata might be encoded as follows: <P>

<PRE>
     &lt META NAME    = "MSW.title"
            CONTENT = "W3C Indexing Work Shop Report" &gt
        
     &lt META NAME    = "MSW.author"
            CONTENT = "Wick Nichols" &gt
           
     &lt META NAME    = "MSW.date"
            CONTENT = "May 30, 1996" &gt

</PRE>

<H3> 3. LINKAGE TO THE REFERENCE DESCRIPTION OF A SCHEMA </H3>

It is judged useful to provide a means for linking to the reference
definition of a schema as well.  The proposed convention for doing so
is as follows:<P>

<PRE>
&lt; LINK REL = SCHEMA.<em>schema_identifier</em> HREF="<em>URL</em>" &gt;
</PRE>

Thus, the reference description of one metadata scheme, the Dublin Core
Metadata Element Set, would be referenced in the LINK HREF as follows:

<PRE>
&lt; LINK REL = SCHEMA.dc HREF = "http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core" &gt;
</PRE>

The description of an element could be accessed by the construction of
URL using the # token to identify a named anchor. Thus, the derived
URL below actually links to the <em>title</em> element in the reference
description of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set.
<P>

<PRE>
<A HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#title">http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#title </A>
</PRE>

This URL would correspond to the human-readable description of the
<em>title</em> element within the document by a NAME anchor such as:<P>

<PRE>
&lt;A NAME = "title"&gt; Title &lt;/A&gt;

    The name of the work provided by the author or publisher.
</PRE>

While use of the LINK tag is not required for a given schema, when
used, it will make possible retrieval of the reference definition of a
given schema element, and will therefore reduce the need for a formal
metadata scheme registry.  Multiple LINK tags can be used so that elements 
derived from multiple schemas can be referenced within a single document.
  
<H3> 4. CONSISTENCY OF DESCRIPTION SCHEMAS </H3>

To promote consistency among resource description schemas, it is
suggested that the semantics for metadata elements be related to
existing well-known schemas whenever feasible.
