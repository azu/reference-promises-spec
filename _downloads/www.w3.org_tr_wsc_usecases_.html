    <h2><a href="#abstract" id="abstract" name="abstract" class=
    "anchor">Abstract</a></h2>

    <p>This Note refines the objectives for the Web Security
    Context Working Group deliverables. It elaborates upon the
    group's <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/2005/Security/wsc-charter"><cite>Charter</cite></a>
    <a href="#wsc-charter">[WSC-CHARTER]</a> to explain what the
    group aims to achieve, what technologies may be used and how
    technical proposals will be evaluated. This elaboration is
    limited to the group's technical work and does not cover
    additional activities the group intends to engage in, such as
    ongoing outreach and education.</p>

    <p>This Note also includes an initial collection of use cases
    that the group expects will drive its technical work.</p>

    <p>Since this Note discusses the assumptions, goals, and
    processes the group will use to develop its recommendations,
    the intended audience is similiar to that of the charter of the
    Working Group; group members, the W3C community, developers of
    web user agents, web content providers (server administrators),
    and parties interested and engaged in what the Web Security
    Context Working Group's plans and directions are. It is
    explicitly not targeted at the presumed beneficiaries of the
    group's work, the users of the web, and it is not expected that
    an average user would be able to read this document and
    understand it.</p>

    <h2><a href="#status" id="status" name="status" class=

    <p>This document was produced by the <a href= "http://www.w3.org/2006/WSC/">Web Security Context
    Working Group</a>, as part of the <a href= "http://www.w3.org/Security/Activity.html">Security
    Activity</a>.  Several Working Drafts for this Note were available for review; the material in
    this document was subject to a public last call.  At the time of publication, the Working Group
    has no specific plans to further revise this document.</p>
    
    <p>Publication as a Working Group Note does not imply endorsement by
    the W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be

      "anchor">1 Overview</a></h2>

      <p>Web user agents are now used to engage in a great variety
      and number of commercial and personal activities. Though the
      medium for these activities has changed, the potential for
      fraud has not. This Working Group is chartered to recommend
      user interfaces that help users make trust decisions on the
      Web.</p>

      <p>This first Working Group document elaborates upon the
      group's <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2005/Security/wsc-charter"><cite>Charter</cite></a>
      <a href="#wsc-charter">[WSC-CHARTER]</a> to explain what the
      group aims to achieve, what technologies may be used and how
      proposals will be evaluated. This elaboration is limited to
      the group's technical work and does not cover additional
      activities the group intends to engage in, such as ongoing
      outreach and education.</p>

      <p>The work outlined in this document is expected to take
      existing standards and best practices into account. Where
      relevant, such existing work will be leveraged.</p>

        <p>A web browsing session is like a conversation, where the

        underlying protocol, including DNS and SSL, other
        designators are bound to these resources and the entities
        that provide them. Recommending a presentation for these

      inform these decisions; and usable ways of communicating
      needed information to the user. Our use-cases are first
      structured by the kind of decision facing the user, where

      available to inform a decision is primarily determined by how
      the user navigated to the web page where the decision arose.
      Our use-cases are further categorized by the different means
      of navigating the Web. Finally, the feasible user
      interactions for communicating relevant information are
      limited by the I/O features of the web user agent. Our

          <p>The Web is most often used for viewing information

          attack yet other computers. Choosing to not install an

          <p>The user agent in a mobile browser typically differs

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Screen: a small, limited color viewing area</p>

            <li>
              <p>Navigation input: small keyboard, stylus or
              pointing device</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Small keyboard pad: on-screen keyboard and
              predictive text technology, such as T9</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Tactile feedback: vibration</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A/V interfaces</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Traffic cost awareness, slow connection speed and
          trust in the mobile network infrastructure may also
          affect how users interact with their smartphone's user
          agent. These factors influence how security indicators
          are presented by different smartphone user agents.</p>

          <p>In mobile browsers, the chrome has fewer options and
          overlaps with the phone's menus. Obtaining secondary
          information is cumbersome, requiring several clicks. Due
          to a lack of screen space, the padlock is shown but the
          URL is only partially shown, if at all. Password
          management is not supported in all phones. In some cases,
          an accessed web page has a modified look and feel,
          different from simply viewing the page on a small screen.
          These changes may create suspicion among security-aware
          users. User agents rarely check for certificate
          revocation, since doing so generates network traffic.
          Some certificate authorities commonly found in desktop
          browsers are not included in smartphone user agents.
          Consequently, the user may be presented with warnings
          that do not appear when the same site is visited using a
          desktop user agent. Large pages that do not fit in the
          phone's RAM can cause unexpected behavior in the user
          agent's security indicators.</p>

            trust is well placed, since the sites aim to serve
            useful hyperlinks. An attacker, posing as a normal site
            contributor, may cause the site to serve a hyperlink to
            an attack page. In this case, a user may follow the
            hyperlink, and apply their trust for the site to the
            attacker's page.</p>

            refers to the expected destination page can be made to

            content from which the request was produced. The target

            <p>The rendering of a web page composed of only static
            content has a completion point, after which the
            rendered view remains constant until the user chooses

            anything that changes this interaction or is given
            additional access to user agent functions. Java and

        <p>Modern browsers include a password manager that can
        autofill the corresponding user login credentials for a web

        can help users notice and avoid web based attempts to steal
        their passwords. Autofilling provides a presentation cue
        indicating the credentials have been previously submitted
        to the web site. The user may then infer that the current
        operation is simply a repeat of a past trust decision,
        rather than a new trust decision: the decision to give the
        web site the corresponding password has already been made.
        A password manager can also eliminate the step of typing a
        password into a web page, a step highly vulnerable to

      <p>Though much implementation progress has been made, there
      remain problems with the basic design for communicating
      security information to the user, which is the core of the
      mission of this Working Group. In current user agents,
      security information is primarily presented through modal
      dialog boxes and indicators in the browser's chrome. Chrome
      is the representation through which the user interacts with
      the user agent itself, as distinct from the web content
      accessed. In graphical layout terms, chrome is the part of
      the user agent window outside of the area displaying the
      current web page. This user interface has a number of
      inherent problems, as well as problems created by the current
      realization.</p>

        for chrome</a></h3>

        <p>The above definition of chrome reveals a major
        shortcoming in the concept. Chrome is primarily defined by
        where it is not, rather than where it is. As a result,
        there are a number of tricks for confusing the user about
        which parts of their screen contain browser chrome.</p>

          name="picture-in-picture" class="anchor">9.1.1 Picture in
          picture</a></h4>

          <p>Modern desktop operating systems support overlapping
          windows of varying sizes. A smaller browser window
          overlaying a larger browser window can be visually
          indistinguishable from a larger browser window displaying
          a picture of a smaller browser window in the web page
          area. Using dynamic content technology, this picture of a
          window can be given functionality that closely mimicks
          that of a real browser window. In this case, the user may
          treat the web page content as a real browser window and
          believe the imitation chrome is real chrome.</p>

          <p>This level of visual deception may be unnecessary to
          fool many users. Studies have demonstrated that many
          users still do not fully grasp the flexibility of the
          desktop metaphor and wrongly believe the security
          indicators of one browser window also pertain to another
          located on top of, or next to it. <a href=

          "extended-chrome" class="anchor">9.1.2 Visually extending
          the chrome</a></h4>

          <p>The strongest visual cue the user is given for the
          boundary between the chrome area and the web page area is
          a change in background color. The chrome uses the
          background color for application menus, typically a light
          grey, and the web page area uses whatever background
          color it wishes, but typically white. There is nothing
          preventing the web page from using the same background
          color as the chrome area for part of the web page area
          near the chrome. In this case, the chrome area may appear
          to be extended with additional security indicators
          specified by the web page. In addition, color only cues
          often do not work for users who are color blind.</p>

          <p>Curiously, recent releases of prominent browsers now
          use a similar technique to present security information
          to the user from the web page area. Typically the chrome
          extension uses a light yellow background and appears near

        The current chrome indicators provide a thin summary of raw

          <p>The presence of the padlock icon in the chrome only

          an imposter site can be accessed using the SSL protocol.
          On its own, the fact that SSL was used is not actionable.
          The fact must first be paired with many others before a
          warranted decision can be made. Nevertheless, some
          studies have shown the presence of a padlock icon, when

          <p>DNS is a hierarchical name space. Name assignments on

          <p>Perhaps the most surprising result of user studies is

        name="usability-testing" class="anchor">10.4 Implementation
        and testing</a></h3>

        <p>Part of a Working Group's activities is developing code
        and test suites <a href="#w3c-process">[W3C
        Process]</a>.</p>

        <p>The Working Group aims to demonstrate and test the WG's
        recommendations on usable and robust communication of
        security context information through implementations within
        the framework of one or more web user agents. The most
        likely web user agents to serve as platforms for such
        implementations are web browsers. To demonstrate that
        recommendations are sufficiently general and interoperable,
        we expect implementation in the context of at least two web
        user agents.</p>

        <p>We are targetting three types of testing of our
        recommendations: functional testing, robustness testing,
        and usability testing <a href="#w3c-testing">[W3C
        Testing]</a>.</p>

        <p>All test development and testing is iterative. The
        recommendations may need to be modified on the basis of all
        three types of testing. Test development starts when work
        on the specification starts. Test planning will include
        guidelines for developing tests. Test suites are typically
        developed when the specifications are in a reasonably
        stable state, such as the first full public working draft.
        Test development will include test execution instructions.
        Automation of the tests will be considered but is unlikely,
        as the tests will require human visual confirmation. Clear
        descriptions of what to expect and how to judge outcome
        will be part of each test.</p>

        <p>Functional testing against the sample code and
        appropriate deployment configurations will verify that the
        recommendations can be translated to web user agent code,
        with no functional ill effects on the rest of the web user
        agent. It will show that implementations can conform to the
        recommendations, and that the specifications clearly define
        behaviors. This is also called conformance testing.</p>

        <p>Robustness testing will verify that the recommendations
        are robust against spoofing attacks. Existing spoofing
        attacks will be documented, and new spoofing attacks aimed
        directly at the recommendations (both required and
        recommended) will be developed. All of these attacks will
        take the form of web site content returned to the user
        agent (most typically DHTML or XML that a web browser
        GETs).</p>

        <p>Usability testing will verify that the recommendations
        provide usable display of security context information. The
        type of usability testing we do will depend on both the
        direction of our recommendations and the resources the
        Working Group is able to tap into. The Working Group aims
        to perform lo fidelity prototyping and testing with a
        modest number of test subjects (10 - 20) for each proposed
        practice that involves user feedback <a href=
        "#tiny-fingers">[Tiny Fingers]</a>. This will be reflected
        in Candidate Recommendation exit criteria. Prototyping at
        this level will provide feedback in early design phases at
        a point where needed changes can be made easily. It will
        also create a more user-centered design process and will
        help in the realization of our goals that address
        usability.</p>

        <p>More extensive user testing will be desirable, and is
        expected to contribute to higher-quality outcomes. More
        extensive tests may include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Incremental testing incorporating feedback from
            previous iterations</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Recruiting participants from broader groups which
            better represent target user groups, either in size or
            relevant characteristics</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Lab testing of sample code, for example <a href=
            "#johnny-2">[Johnny 2]</a></p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Contextual or "in the wild" testing of sample code
            <a href="#social-phishing">[Social Phishing]</a></p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>More iterative combinations of the above, throughout
            the specification lifecycle</p>
          </li>
