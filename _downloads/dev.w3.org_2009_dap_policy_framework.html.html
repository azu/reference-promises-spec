    <section id='introduction'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	The policy framework described in this document is intended to be
	applicable both to widgets and web applications (web site access to
	Device APIs).
      </p>
   <p>
      This security model is based on a clear
      separation between the definition of the general framework and the creation
      of specific trust and access policies. This allows the configured policies of
      a web runtime to be adapted to the needs of different stakeholders at any
      time during the lifecycle of a product. This includes, but is not limited
      to, the embedding and configuration of web runtimes at manufacture as well
      as post-sales installation of web runtimes.
    </p> <p>
      As a general high-level objective, it should be noted that the security
      framework is intended to protect the device and its user from
      web applications 
      that pose a security risk from unintentional but undetected
      implementation flaws 
      as well as those that are malicious.
    </p> <p>
      The intention is that the framework, at the most general level,
      allows a very 
      wide range of policies to be represented (although manageability and
      interoperability concerns require there to be a certain level of
      similarity and 
      compatibility in policy structure). However, the framework must permit
      fine-grained security policies to be represented as well as
      policies based on 
      broad groupings of APIs and assignment of web applications to a 
      small number of 
      trust domains. For example, a fine-grained access policy is
      necessary to grant 
      or deny access to individual APIs for individual web applications.
    </p> <p>
      This framework is based on a very general model that governs
      both trust domain access by <a href=#subject>subjects</a> 
      to <a href=#resource>resources</a> based on a hierarchy
      of <a href=#trust-policy>trust
      policies</a>, access policies
      and <a href=#policy-set>policy sets</a>, where each policy 
      consists of a number of <a href=#rule>rules</a>.
      A subject corresponds to an entity that may attempt security-relevant actions and represents a single identity. This identity can describe either a widget resource or a website. 
      Resources are associated with the
      API <a href=#feature>features</a>
      and <a href=#device-capability>device capabilities</a> used to
      access device features or services (e.g. the location module or
      PIM database) that are being protected. 
      Subjects and resources are characterised by a
      number of defined <a href=#subject-attribute>subject
      attributes</a> and <a href=#resource-attribute>resource
      attributes</a>, respectively. A range of 
      attributes is defined so that access policies can be expressed
      based 
      on a widget resource signer's identity, or an individual widget resource
      identity, or the widget resource signature’s root certificate, or a website's
      URL.
      Therefore, the generality of this framework derives from the range of
      attributes that are supported, as well as the flexible structure of policies and
      policy sets in the security model.
    </p> 
	<p>The XACML Policy Profile for Device APIs specifies a profile of
	  XACML 2.0 [[XACML20]] for the framework described in this document
	  [[DAP-XACML-POLICY-PROFILE]].

      <section id="concepts">
	<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
    <section id="trust-domains">
	<h2>Trust Domains</h2>
	  <p>
 Content properties such as content origin and
signatures can be used to map to trust domains. 
Trust policies may be used to specify these mappings. For example, a
 policy 
can specify the set of origin URLs corresponding to a trust domain, or
 map a certificate associated with a widget signature to a trust
 domain. 
Trust domains may be assigned when content is installed or at run time.
In the first case, the installer determines a
trust domain from the trust engine and saves this securely to the
installed content registry. When content is run, the runtime can retrieve
the saved trust domain from the registry. In the second case, the runtime
gets the trust domain directly from the trust engine when the content
is run. In both cases, the runtime must maintain a reference to the trust
domain associated with the content in such a way that the trust domain
can be specified when requesting an access control decision.
</p>
<p>
Trust domains can be based on origin, signatures or be "Untrusted", to
list three common cases.</p>
<p>
Access control is a two step process. First the trust domain is
determined, and then based on that trust domain the appropriate access
control policy is used to make a policy decision.
</p>
</section>
    <section id="features">
	<h2>Features</h2>
	  <p>
A feature is a set of one or more capabilities that in combination
forms a logical construct that may require access control.
(or shall we define a feature in terms of high level methods).
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<dfn id="feature">feature</dfn></dt>
<dd> <p> A feature is the unit of expression of
    dependencies by web applications. (This definition needs clarification).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Feature dependencies are
    expressed as an IRI. It is the responsibility of the author of the
    feature in question to define the feature and any associated API,
    and to advertise the corresponding IRI. It is also possible, using
    standard IRI techniques, to create a family of IRIs so that the
    feature definition is "parameterised". It is up to the author of
    the feature definition to specify the valid usage and meaning of
    the associated IRIs in this case. For widgets, features are
    identified in the configuration document by
    the <code>feature</code> element's <code>name</code> attribute
    [[!WIDGETS]]. </p>
<p>
    An example of a feature IRI would be: TBD </p>
     <div class="issue">

    IRIs are defined, feature IRI examples. See BONDI A&amp;S document,
    pages 31 and 32.</p></div> 
</section>
      <section id="capabilities">
	<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
<dfn id="device-capability">device capability</dfn>
<dd> <p> A device capability is a
    device resource or device functionality
that may require access control.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p> 
    Examples of device
      capabilities are the ability to read a local file, or to discover
    nearby Bluetooth devices, or to send an SMS message. Device
    capabilities may be defined in a way that is independent of the
    specific Device APIs that an application uses to access them. 
          Although there are simple Device APIs that provide access only to
          a single Device Capability,  there are also
          more complex APIs that expose multiple Device Capabilities; examples
          might include a camera API that provides the ability to geotag a photo
          with the current location, or a messaging API that provides the
          ability to access documents stored locally and attach them to outgoing
          messages. Therefore, enabling or disabling access to a specific Device
          Capability may not directly correspond to enabling or disabling
          access to a single Device API interface.</p>

<section id="architecture">
  <h2>Framework Architecture</h2>
    <section id="layered-model">
    <h3>Layered Model</h3>
     <p>
      A web application uses a mechanism specified in this document to gain access to (or bind to)
      a JavaScript API by stating one or more features exposed by the JavaScript API. This access is given on a basis of the trust domain that has been assigned to the web application.
      The implementation of the API, in turn, makes use of one or more device
      capabilities, defined in terms of facilities that might be provided by APIs at
      the device, platform or OS level, but without reference to any particular API.
      Where a JavaScript API is defined within the this model, each function definition
      specifies which feature it implements, and which device capabilities it uses.
    </p> <p>
      The mechanisms provided in this specification to bind to APIs, and to control access (both to
      the features and the device capabilities exposed by them) are generic, and are
      not themselves dependent on any particular set of JavaScript APIs. This
      model envisages that these controls apply, irrespective of whether the APIs in
      use are defined by DAP or any independent entity. <!-- This "layering” of
      JavaScript APIs and mediating access control is illustrated in the figure below. -->
    </p>
    <section id="trust-domain-control-layer">
    <h4>Trust Domain Control Layer</h4>
      <p>
	The trust domain control layer controls the assignment of the appropiate
	trust domain to the web application via the relevant <strong><em><dfn id="trust-policy">trust policy</dfn></em></strong>. In
	general, trust policies will select one trust domain or another
	depending on the <a href=#subject-attribute>subject attributes</a> and <a href=#environment-attribute>environment attributes</a> that
	identify the web application.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- trust domain control layer -->
    <section id="api-access-control-layer">
    <h4>JavaScript API Access Control Layer</h4>
      <p>
	The JavaScript API access control layer controls access
	to JavaScript APIs exposed by the web runtime. Each <a href=#feature>feature</a> is
	identified uniquely by IRI, and this security layer mediates access to
	features on the basis of that
	ID.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- API access control layer -->
    <section id="device-capability-access-control-layer">
    <h4>Device Capability Access Control Layer</h4>
      <p>
	The device capability access control layer controls
	access to the underlying capabilities of the device when used from JavaScript
	APIs. These device capabilities themselves are identified so that it is possible
	to write security policies that control access to specific capabilities
	independently of the JavaScript APIs used to access them.
      </p>
      <p>
	For both JavaScript API and device capability access control layers, access permissions are guaranteed or restricted on a basis of  via <strong><em><dfn id="access-control-policy">access control policies</dfn></em></strong>. In general, access control policies will select the effect of a particular access request depending on the <a href=#resource-attribute>resources attributes</a> captured when the request happened.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- device capability access control layer -->
    <section id=feature-capability-reqs>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
      <p>
	This explicit separation of features and their dependent device capabilities addresses a
	number of significant requirements, as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><p><strong>Extensibility is an intrinsic part of the security model.</strong> It is expected that APIs will be defined and implemented
	independently, and the nature of those APIs will not necessarily be known to the
	author of a security policy. Therefore, if a security policy author wishes to
	deny access to a specific device capability, then there must be a way of doing
	this that is independent of the JavaScript API being used.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The web runtime must only grant access to features that are
	advertised as being dependencies of the web application.</strong> The access control system must ensure
	that only requested features are accessible to the web
	application. This requires that the access control system is able to
	control access based on the ID of a Feature.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>There will not be a direct 1-1 correspondence between JavaScript APIs
	and device capabilities.</strong> Although there will be simple JavaScript APIs that
	provide access only to a single device capability, it must be expected that
	there are also more complex APIs that expose multiple device capabilities;
	examples might include a camera API that provides the ability to geotag a photo
	with the current location, or a messaging API that provides the ability to
	access documents stored locally and attach them to outgoing messages. Therefore,
	enabling or disabling access to a specific device capability will not directly
	correspond to enabling or disabling access to a single JavaScript API.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Implementations of JavaScript APIs need not be as highly
	trusted as the web runtime.</strong> Authors of access policies may require the ability to
	control access to specific JavaScript APIs, or families of APIs, based on the
	identity of the API (and not just the device capabilities it exposes), according
	to the trustworthiness of the author of the API.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>It must be possible to represent both trust and access policies
	portably.</strong> This implies that all identifiers used in a security
	policy (both for features and for device capabilities) must be portably defined,
	and not (for example) based on any platform-specific API names. This requires
	that the identifiers for device capabilities are defined in a
	platform-independent way. <!-- BONDI defines a set of these capabilities in
	Appendix A.--></p></li>

    <h3>Logical Model</h3>
     <p>
      On the one hand, the trust domain control system explained in this
      document, from a logical perspective, represents the system by which a web
      application that attempts to access device capabilities using JavaScript
      APIs, is assigned a trust or security domain. This trust domain will then
      be used in subsequent access requests, simplifying the whole process. On
      the other hand, the access control system, implementing a specific access
      control policy, has the sole effect of making and enforcing an access
      control decision in relation to each attempted access. (In order to make
      that decision the access control system may request interactive
      confirmation from the user, but this is invisible to the requesting web
      application.)
    </p> <p>
      Both the trust and access control systems consist of a number of logically distinct
      elements. <!-- Specific DAP requirements and interfaces are specified in terms of
      these separate functional components. --> This logical breakdown and associated
      terminology is adopted from  XACML [[XACML20]] and illustrated below.
    </p>
    <!-- ILLUSTRATION XACML DATAFLOW -->

 <img src="dataflow.png" alt="graphical representation of the data flow" title="Security model, derived from XACML Specification Schema" width="595" height="454"/> <!-- </object> -->
    <p>
      The specified <strong>functional components</strong> are as follows:
      <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Policy Decision Point (PDP):</strong> for trust domain requests, the module that evaluates which trust domain should be assigned to a web application; for access requests, the module that evaluates whether or not a device API can be accessed by a web
      application, based on the current policy.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):</strong> for trust domain requests, the module that assigns a trust domain to a particular web application; for access requests, the module that allows or prevents access to device APIs.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Policy Information Point (PIP):</strong> the module that gathers information to
      be used by the PDP to evaluate a trust domain or an access control request. For trust domain requests, it
      collects the subject attributes (i.e. how the web application was identified and
      its associated security attributes), whereas for access requests, resource attributes (i.e. which device
      API is being requested and using which parameters) and environment attributes (i.e.
      status of the device) are collected.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Policy Administration Point (PAP):</strong> the authority that
      defines the policy. It could be a network operator, a terminal manufacturer, a
      web runtime developer, an enterprise or a user at runtime. Policies can be
      provided by the PAP in different ways, for instance using a preloaded file or
      data structure, or a remote management mechanism (e.g. OMA DM [[OMA-DM]]).</p></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="issue">
	<p>OMA DM reference missing?</p>
	<p>Should we include this?: In the present phase, DAP does not define any specific external interface requirements for
      the PAP, although this may be in scope for later phases. The security policy
      itself is not defined by DAP, although a default policy may be recommended by
      DAP at a future stage.</p></div> 
    <p>
      The functionality required in each of these components is
      specified in terms of the following <strong>entities</strong>:
<dl>
<dt><dfn id="subject">subject</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>the web application
      that requires access to JavaScript APIs. Examples of subjects are websites
      and widgets.</p>
<p>An entity that may attempt 
	  security-relevant actions and corresponds to a single
	  "identity". (In practice, some web applications might
	  have multiple identities – for example is a widget
	  resource is signed by multiple signers – but for the
	  purposes of this model, each access control query is
	  considered to involve a single subject and hence a
	  single identity.) </p>
	  <p> The website identity type applies to all operations
	  occurring in the execution of a remotely-hosted
	  document, whether this is the top-level document of the
	  website or is associated with some child browsing
	  context (such as an iframe). </p>
</dd>
<dt><dfn id="subject-attribute">subject attribute</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>Every subject is associated with a set of
      attributes. Subject attributes allow the identification of the web
      application that is attempting access to device capabilities using device
      APIs. The identified web application is then assigned a trust domain
      according to the appropriate trust policy. Subject attributes include
      specific attributes that represent the identity of the web application
      attempting access to a resource. Valid identity attributes include the
      widget identifier URI for widgets and the URL for websites; other
      identifiers may be supported. Subject attributes also include the
      credentials used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the subject,
      e.g. a TLS or code signing digital certificate. Other

<p>
From a logical perspective, an access control query can be evaluated at any time between the point that the necessary attribute values become available and when the attempted operation is performed. In the case of a JavaScript API call for which arguments supplied to the call are designated resource attributes, the relevant attributes are only known once the API call has been made by the calling web application. However, in other cases the information may be known earlier. For example, if all feature requirements are stated in a widget configuration document, and none of the API access operations have conditions depending on API call parameters, then all access control queries may be evaluated fully at widget resource installation time.
