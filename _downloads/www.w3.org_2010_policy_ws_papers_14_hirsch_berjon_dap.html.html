        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          We presented a position paper at the W3C Workshop on Privacy for
          Advanced Web APIs held 12-13 July 2010 in London [<a href="#fn1">1</a>]. In that paper we
          noted that the application programming interfaces (APIs) work that the
          W3C Device APIs and Policy Working Group (DAP)
          [<a href="#fn2">2</a>] is chartered to perform 
          represents a significant risk to users' privacy.
          This remains the case. Those
          APIs can enable 
          arbitrary Web pages to have access to
          the user's contacts database, personal calendar, local file system,
          and todo list. They would be also be able to capture stills,
          video, and 
          audio from the  user's webcam and microphone as well as 
          be able to send emails and 
          SMSs on the user's behalf.  
        </p>
        <p>
          While not enough, access control security mechanisms are
          important to privacy. Although user interaction on every
          access is a form of access control, the WG charter
          specifically calls out the deliverable of defining a policy
          framework for access control
          [<a href="#fn3">3</a>].

          In fact, the name of the WG is "W3C
          Device APIs and  
          Policy Working Group", indicating the importance of policy.
          The WG already has started a draft of an
          API access control framework 
          [<a href="#fn4">4</a>] but has decided to 
          focus on implications for the wider web before progressing this work.
          The WG is taking a first step of  defining relevant features
          and permissions
          [<a href="#fn5">5</a>]. 
          A draft WG requirements
          document summarizes various  use cases including
          general web pages, trusted and untrusted widgets, and
          delegated authority  
          [<a href="#fn6">6</a>].
        </p>
        <p>The DAP WG is taking privacy and security 
          seriously. This paper summarizes the current status of the
          WG work on privacy and suggests some next steps. It also
          outlines the issues related to access control and approaches
          the WG is taking in this area.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy Risks and Approach</h2>
        <p>
          In our paper for the previous W3C Privacy  Workshop we noted
          that Web privacy risks are often not 
          understood and are larger than might be expected. We 
          highlighted that technologies can be used in unexpected ways
          introducing new privacy threats. During the workshop we
          discussed that the problem 
          goes beyond minimization of the data returned by an API
          since subsequent risks include correlation of data over time
          and from different sources. An excellent example is
          using location information of an individual over time to
          intuit meaning (e.g. this must be 
          "home"), combining it with other place information 
          (e.g. knowing that a strip
          club is located at a place where the user was located),
          and  making (possibly incorrect)  deductions about
          individual behavior.  
          Meaningful privacy involves the entire system of which
          APIs are only a part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing what it can, the DAP WG is working toward designing 
          the APIs to consider privacy from the outset.  We have
          documented privacy requirements specific to our API
          development, including an architectural approach that
          emphasizes usability and principles encompassing notice,
          consent, minimization, control, access, retention, secondary
          use and sharing [<a href="#fn7">7</a>]. We did
          not document broader privacy principles such as "Privacy by
          Design" as our intent is to focus on specifics of our WG and
          not reiterate generally accepted privacy principles.
        </p>
        <p>Preventing an open set of  risks in a complex system
          is difficult if not impossible, as those who work in the
          security and privacy areas know. Thus non-technical legal
          and social mechanisms must work together with technical
          approaches to mitigate risks.
          From a technical perspective, we decided to start with
          basics, to 
          minimize the data returned by APIs, and to examine carefully the 
          the role of user interaction and consent. The WG is 
          taking the approach that user interactions should be natural
          to the user's view of the  workflow. This is to avoid the
          use of meaningless prompts to which a user would always
          respond "yes", not knowing what else to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also are 
          considering extensions to the APIs to share user privacy
          constraints, but in a simple and usable way. This would
          support legal and social 
          mechanisms used to enhance privacy. Specifically the WG is
          evaluating the 
          Ruleset approach that was
          presented at the previous W3C privacy workshop 
          [<a href="#fn8">8</a>] [<a href="#fn9">9</a>]. 
          This approach is promising in that it offers a usable and
          understandable mechanism for a user to
          specify in a broad stroke how they wish data to be retained,
          shared  and used, drawing on 
          Creative Commons experience. There is not consensus in the WG
          at this time whether this 
          approach should be taken, due to concerns about the impact
          on browser and other implementations.
        </p>
        <h2>Access Control Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Access Control is important for controlling who can use specific
          information and device capabilities. It is not always
          desireable to require user interaction on every request,
          especially in an application that requires a number of
          device features, perhaps repeatedly. In some cases authority
          can be delegated and managed more effectively using a policy
          definition and enforcement mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feasibility and value of declarative policy for access
          control depends on the use case.  The trusted widget use
          case, for example, lends itself to policy designed to be
          portable across devices and providers.
          A trusted widget packages the
          various elements of a web application into one bundle that
          can be loaded into the device and use device
          APIs to provide useful functionality
          [<a href="#fn10">10</a>], [<a href="#fn11">11</a>].
          Trust can be established in a variety of ways, including
          secure download from a trusted source, or verification of 
          a signature on the widget package in conjunction with
          certificate trust chain validation
          [<a href="#fn12">12</a>],
          to give two examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          In cases where trust in the application making the API requests can be
          established, declarative policy could be used to enable specification
          of access control rules portable across devices and services 
          consistent with the DAP standard. This would give users freedom to
          avoid lock-in and make changes in devices and services. It would also
          eliminate the need for many cumbersome user interactions for
          permission, especially for applications that require many device
          resources and capabilities over a period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          A different use case is that of a web page that uses device APIs to
          provide a web based application. An example might be a page that uses
          the users contacts information to enable social networking
          aggregation, or perhaps to provide an email client.
          In such cases it might
          be difficult to bind policy with a specific application, if
          there is no pre-existing relationship and an arbitrary web site is
          visited by the user. 
          An approach under consideration by the DAP WG is user-mediated introduction
          of web page applications to resource sources (on the device
          or web), enabling user
          control of the introduction
          [<a href="#fn13">13</a>]. This could be an alternative to
          declarative policy, or used in conjunction with it, perhaps 
          using policy mechanisms  after the initial introduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Declarative policy for access control is appropriate for
          some delegated authority cases, either
          where an organization such as an enterprise or mobile
          operator wishes to 
          establish constraints on API use on users and devices
          associated with 
          the organization, or where an individual would like to
          simplify their decisions by relying on a service provider
          for help managing their device. Declarative policy may also
          be appropriate for cases where a user wishes to remember
          decisions made earlier and perhaps apply them to new cases,
          without relying on a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerns related to policy include the ability to deploy
          policy in a distributed system  
          that encompasses a large variety of platforms for various
          use cases, some  
          possibly conflicting. There are also fundamental concerns
          about users being able to 
          understand and articulate policy correctly when authority is
          not delegated (or even to be able to clearly articulate
          policy in the delegated authority case).
        </p>
        <p> The WG is considering the implications of
          policy for a
          variety of use cases, including web pages, trusted widgets and
          cases where 
          policy can be managed through delegated authority. 
          The latest draft of the Access Control Use
          Cases and Requirements discusses the various use cases and
          how they relate to policy
          [<a href="#fn6">6</a>], and the Policy Framework draft
          outlines a starting point for a policy framework based on
          contributions to the WG.
          The WG does not yet have consensus on the role of policy in
          solving the wider
          problem,  to  enable
          safe and privacy-respecting access to personal data from applications
          running in the Web at large and is working on understanding
          the broader picture before focusing on the details of a framework.  
        </p>
        <h2>More questions and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          What is emerging is the thinking that there needs to be a fundamental
          safety net in APIs that does not rely on a universal policy framework. This
          requires basic APIs 
          to be safe by default, or to require user interaction on a
          minimalistic set of  APIs that are not safe.  Unfortunately it
          is hard to define a "safe" API, if such a concept is even
          possible, due to the many potential uses of the API.
          Correlation and use of  API data and functionality over time,
          place and   among various parties makes it hard to establish
          what is safe. It is a complex problem that is
          unlikely to have a simple "silver-bullet" solution. We can,
          however, clearly identify simpler unsafe cases of API use and
          attempt to eliminate those.
        </p> 
        <p>We agree that user 
          interaction should  be a 
          natural
          part of a  workflow that is meaningful to a user, and not a
          dialog that asks permission to perform some low-level
          operation that has no meaning to the user. This enables
          permission in a usable manner while avoiding the security risk of answering "yes" to
          anything to get on with a task. 
          The act of 
          proceeding with a workflow implies user permission to
          continue, for example selecting contact for an operation
          rather than canceling the operations implies user consent to
          use that information in the operation.
          We would like to encourage this approach by being clear in API definitions where it is
          appropriate and necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to understand how a policy framework might relate to various
          use cases, a first step is to define the permissions (or
          capabilities) that are appropriate to the various APIs and how
          they might be identified and used. We also need to clarify how
          APIs are themselves identified (presumably by method name, but
          granularity remains an issue here).  </p>
        <p>It seems clear that for usability we need the concept of an
          "application", not only for trusted widgets, but also for web
          pages that offer functionality based on various device APIs.
          We need to understand how such an application might be installed and
          obtain the permissions it needs, both for trusted and
          untrusted cases. In an untrusted case it might not be enough
          to grant no access, and a trusted case may require
          limitations. This is exactly the area policy is designed to
          address, but previous approaches were not designed for the
          web.
          We need to remain aware of the security issues that have occurred
          with the installations of applications on personal computers,
          suggesting the importance of trust. It may be that DAP does
          not cover all use cases, but focuses on those that are
          tractable to trust and policy, but the WG has not reached the
          point of making such decisions.
        </p>
        <p>We note that privacy is always a concern, even in a trusted
          environment and even with delegated authority such as in an
          enterprise. In such environments APIs may offer more functionality
          using more API capabilities, but  individual privacy will still need
          to be respected.
        </p>
        <p>       The DAP WG continues to work on privacy and policy
          requirements and 
          mechanisms and is open to contributions and
          suggestions. </p>
