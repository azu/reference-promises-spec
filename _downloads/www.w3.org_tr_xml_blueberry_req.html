                    </h2>
                    <p>The W3C's XML 1.0         Recommendation <a href="#rec-xml">
    [XML]</a>
  was first issued in 1998,         and despite the issuance of  many errata 
culminating in a Second Edition         of 2001, has remained (by intention) 
unchanged with respect to what is well-formed XML         and what is not. 
 This stability has been extremely useful for         interoperability.  However,
the Unicode Standard <a href="#rec-unicode"> [Unicode]</a>
  on which  XML 1.0 relies has not         remained static, evolving from 
version 2.0  to version 3.1.  Characters          present in Unicode 3.1 but
not in Unicode  2.0 may be used in XML         character data. &nbsp;However, 
they are not allowed in XML  names such as element type          names, attribute 
names, enumerated attribute values, processing instruction  targets, and so
on.  In         addition, some characters that should have  been permitted 
in XML names         were not, due to oversights and inconsistencies  in Unicode
2.0.</p>
                    <p>As a result, fully native-language XML         markup
  is not possible in <em>at least</em> the following languages:         
Amharic, Burmese,  Canadian aboriginal languages, Cherokee,  Dhivehi, Hakka
Chinese (Bopomofo script), Khmer, Minnan Chinese         (Bopomofo script),
Mongolian (traditional script), Oromo, Syriac, Tigre, and Yi, because the
characters required to write these languages did not exist in Unicode 2.0.&nbsp;
  In addition, Chinese (particularly as used in Hong Kong) and Japanese can
make use in XML names of         only a subset of their complete character
 repertoires.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>The point has been made that many of these languages
can be written using other scripts, notably the Latin script, which makes<br>
transliterated native markup possible. &nbsp;However, exactly the same argument
applies to many languages (for example, Greek) that were already fully encoded
in Unicode 2.0. &nbsp;Discriminating against languages simply because their
scripts were not encoded in Unicode 2.0 is inherently unjust. &nbsp;In addition,
working with transliteration is far more painful for native readers and writers
than working with the native script.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, XML 1.0 attempts to adapt to the line-end
  conventions         of various modern operating systems, but discriminates
  against the         conventions used on IBM and IBM-compatible mainframes.
&nbsp;As a result, XML documents on mainframes are not plain text files according
to the local conventions. &nbsp;XML 1.0         documents generated on mainframes
must either violate the   local         line-end conventions, or employ otherwise
unnecessary translation           phases before parsing and after generation.
&nbsp;Allowing straightforward interoperability is particularly important
when data stores are shared between mainframe and non-mainframe systems (as
opposed to being copied from one to the other).</p>
                    <p>A new XML version, rather than a set of errata to
XML 1.0, is being created because the change affects the definition of well-formed
 documents. &nbsp;XML 1.0 processors must continue to reject documents that
contain  new characters in XML names or new line-end conventions.  It is
presumed that the distinction between XML 1.0 and XML Blueberry will be indicated
by the XML declaration. </p>
