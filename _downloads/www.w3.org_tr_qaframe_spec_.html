<div id="introduction">
<h2 id="introduction-title">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="scope-goals">1.1 Scope</h3>

<p>This document is a guide for editors of W3C specifications. It provides guidelines for improving conformance-related characteristics.  In that respect, this document differs from other W3C process and publication-related documents. It addresses the most basic and critical topics with respect to conformance, including how to convey what is required for an implementation in order to conform and how to allow variation among conforming implementations.</p>

<p>The term <dfn>specification</dfn> is used as defined in <cite>ISO Guide 2-4</cite> [<a href="#isoguide24">ISO-GUIDE</a>] as meaning a document that prescribes requirements to be fulfilled by a product, process or service. Specifications can be defined in one document or as a coherent set of several documents (see <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-spec-variability-20050629/#umbrella">Umbrella specifications</a></cite> in <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/spec-variability/">Variability in Specifications</a></cite> [<a href="#VIS">VIS</a>] for more discussion), and can import requirements of other specifications with normative references.
</p>

<p>In addition to conformance, there are several other topics that should be addressed when writing a specification, such as accessibility, internationalization, security, and device independence.  These topics are not directly in the scope of this document, but are evoked in <a href="#address-other-topics">section 3.3</a>. Specification authors and editors are encouraged to consider these topics and coordinate their efforts in these areas with the relevant W3C Working Groups.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">1.2 Goals and Motivation</h3>

<p>The goal is to enable Working Groups to produce specifications that are precise, easier to interpret without ambiguity or confusion, and clearer as to what is required in order to conform. Good specifications lead to better and more interoperable implementations and foster the development of test suites and tools.</p>

<p>Everyone benefits from having well-written specifications. Editors may have less rework and thus, fewer issues raised during the development of the specification, and fewer errata once it is finished. Implementers can implement sooner and have a better chance to conform to the specification. Test developers are able to derive unambiguous test assertions. End users benefit from having interoperable solutions. W3C gains by having recommendations produced with higher quality and reduced maintenance.</p>


<h3 id="why-spec-gl">1.3 Why Specification Guidelines?</h3>

<p>It is not an easy task to write accurate, clear, complete, unbiased specifications. It requires planning, organization, and foresight about the technology, how it will be implemented and used, and how technical decisions affect conformance. This document provides a collection of requirements, good practices, examples, and techniques that lead the reader through the decisions necessary to write precise requirements and establish, define, and specify conformance for specifications.</p>

<p>Editors and authors are busy, under pressure to get the specification published, and already have a reading list of W3C documents. A good place to start is <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/Editors/">W3C Editor's Home Page</a></cite> [<a href="#EDITOR">EDITOR</a>]. This document can be used as a checklist of things to consider, a how-to guide with examples and techniques that can be adapted, and a reference for understanding conformance concepts and terminology.</p>



<h3 id="audience">1.4 Audience of This Document</h3>

<p>The primary audience of this document is editors; however, it is applicable to a broader audience including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Those who review specifications during their development,</li>
  <li>Implementers of specifications,</li>
  <li>Builders of test materials, including conformance test suites and   tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document makes no distinction between the terms editors and authors and  refers to them collectively as editors.</p>


<h3 id="about">1.5 About This Document</h3>

<p>
This document is a practical guide to writing a specification, presenting editors with topics to consider. The normative content is contained in a collection of a <strong>small number of Requirements</strong>, and somewhat more <strong>Good Practices</strong>.Â  As explained in this specification's <a href="#conformance">conformance clause</a>, the Requirements are necessary for claiming conformance to Specification Guidelines, and the Good Practices are recommendations that will further benefit the quality of a specification.</p>

<p>The overall objective of these requirements and good practices is to facilitate the creation of a complete conformance clause in every specification. A <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2004/08/SpecGL-template-root.html">conformance clause template</a></cite> [<a href="#CONF-TEMPLATE">CONF-TEMPLATE</a>] is provided to assist editors satisfy the requirements of this document and end up with a conformance clause. Note that for some technical reports (e.g., <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-qa-handbook-20041122/">The QA Handbook</a></cite> [<a href="#QA-HANDBOOK">QA-HANDBOOK</a>], <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/">Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One</a></cite> [<a href="#WEB-ARCH">WEB-ARCH</a>]) where conformance is not an issue (e.g., no normative content), the conformance clause may be an explanation of why there is no âconformance to this documentâ and may be presented in another section rather than in a separate conformance section.</p>

<p>The topics presented herein are inclusive (self-contained) and provide information needed to understand and successfully apply the Requirement or Good Practice, although related information and advanced topics may be referenced.</p>

<p>If in a hurry just read the <a href="#specifying-conformance">first guidelines section</a>, <cite>Specifying conformance</cite> â this may be all you need to read in order to reach the expected outcome of adhering to this document, i.e. specifying conformance. It serves as a roadmap to other parts of this document, which help  achieve specifying conformance.</p>


<h4 id="structure">1.5.1 Structure of This Document</h4>

<p>This document is organized into a series of guidelines such as <cite>Specifying Conformance</cite> and <cite>Managing Variability</cite>. Each of these guidelines present and explain <em>Requirements</em> and <em>Good Practices</em>.  <em>Techniques</em> and <em>Examples</em> accompany each Requirement and Good Practice. The techniques illustrate basic (and nonexhaustive) questions or methods to help  realize the Requirement/Good Practice and produce specification text.  The examples are explanations or extractions from existing W3C specifications that specifically illustrate the point  made in the Requirement/Good Practice.</p>

<p>The <a href="#conformance">conformance clause</a> of this document describes the conformance requirements  for claiming conformance to this Specification Guidelines. A specification editor who wishes to write a specification conformant to Specification Guidelines must ensure it satisfies the conformance requirements in the conformance section of this document.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines">2. Guidelines</h2>

<h3 id="specifying-conformance">2.1 Specifying Conformance</h3>

<p><dfn>Conformance</dfn> is the fulfillment of specified requirements by a product, process, or service. These requirements are detailed in a specification as part of a conformance clause and in the body of the specification. A <dfn>conformance clause</dfn> is the section of a specification that identifies all the  criteria that must be satisfied in order to claim conformance to the specification.</p>

<p>A clear presentation of conformance is  crucial to successful interoperability of implementations. The conformance model and the language used for normative information determine the testability of a specification.  They also influence the overall implementation landscape, ranging from a narrow conformance with few allowable variations in implementations to multiple conformance types, resulting in numerous variations in conforming implementations.  The model must be chosen carefully, to produce the intended implementation range.
</p>




<h4 id="conformance-clause">2.1.1 A conformance clause is essential.</h4>

<p>A good conformance clause is the ultimate goal of these guidelines, and is sanctioned by  conformance to this specification.</p>

<p>The conformance clause of a specification is a high-level description of what is required of implementations. It, in turn,  refers to other parts of the specification for  details. Ideally, readers can find any conformance-related information from its conformance clause which serves as a root source.</p>

<p>For some specifications, the conformance model may be straightforward and simple, and the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2004/08/SpecGL-template-root.html">conformance clause template</a></cite> [<a href="#CONF-TEMPLATE">CONF-TEMPLATE</a>] when completed, may provide most of the information needed in a conformance clause.Â  For other specifications, when the conformance model is complex or convoluted, the <cite>Advanced Topics</cite> references (see <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/spec-variability/">Variability in Specifications</a></cite> [<a href="#VIS">VIS</a>]) may be invaluable.</p>

Include a conformance clause.</h5>
</div>



<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean? </span>The conformance clause provides the answers to the important questions: what may conform and how? The conformance clause defines at a high-level, what is required of implementers of the specification.Â  It, in turn can refer to other parts of the specification or other specifications.Â  The conformance clause may partition the technology into functional subsets, such as profiles, modules or other structures.Â  Additionally, it may specify minimal requirements for certain functions, as well as extensibility, optional features and alternative approaches and how they are to be handled.</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>
The conformance clause defines what is required to claim conformance: as such, it provides communication between the specification's creators, implementers, and users as to what is required, and gives meaning to the phrase, âconforming implementation.âÂ  Moreover, it facilitates the consistent application of conformance within a specification and across related specifications.Â  It promotes interoperability. </p>

Define the specification's conformance model in the conformance clause.</h5>
</div>





<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> The conformance model is the conceptual framework in which conformance is defined. It consists of and is defined by addressing at least these three topics:</p>
<ul>

	<li>What needs to conform and how â hereafter designated as <dfn>class of products</dfn>.</li>
	<li>Any special designations or concepts used to distinguish conformance categories, types, etc. (e.g., profile/module/level, well-formed/valid, A/AA/AAA).</li>
	<li>Ways that conforming implementations can vary from each other (e.g.,  optionality and extensions).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> The key is to communicate to the reader what conformance to the specification is all about.Â The model provides a framework for implementers, describes what they need to build in order to conform, and explains the different ways that they could claim conformance.Â  It provides users and customers with a basis on which to express their requirements.</p>

<div class="meaning">

Normative content is the prescriptive part of the specification, whereas informative content is for informational purposes and assists in the understanding and use of the specification.

</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>
Conformance of implementations is defined by and measured against normative content.Â  Distinguishing normative content from that which is informative helps to make sure the reader can find the normative content, knows for sure that it is normative, and does not fail to notice a normative section.Â  This good practice aims at the high level partitioning of information (e.g., sections) in a specification.</p>

	<li><strong>Alternatively</strong>, create a list of all sections and indicate their normativity, (e.g., â<a href="#normative-parts"><cite>Normative Parts</cite></a> in this documentâs conformance sectionâ).</li>

<h4 id="specify-conformance">2.1.2 Specify how to make conformance claims.</h4>

<p>The central message of this section â âhave a good conformance clauseâ â has many ancillary details. Because the conformance clause is the foundation for defining and measuring conformance, it is also the basis for assessing conformance claims. One detail worthy of attention is âconformance claims.â</p>

<p>Rather than live with the infinite varieties of creative conformance claims that can arise in a vacuum, the specification can be proactive.</p>

<div id="conformance-claim">
<div class="practice">
<h5 id="conformance-claim-gp"><span class="practice-label">Good Practice 3:</span>
Provide the wording for conformance claims.</h5>
</div>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> 
It is inevitable that people (e.g., vendors, purchasers) will either claim conformance or demand conformance to a technology.    In fact, claiming conformance to a technology may be required in certain situations.  Thus, it is important to provide a consistent and unambiguous way to make these claims. Identification of the specification version, class of products, and conformance label are some of the items that could be part of such wording.
</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>
Having a framework, by which to make conformance claims for a particular usage of the technology, minimizes confusion by people who are interested in such claims. Many contexts use conformance claims, including legal as part of regulations, laws, or policies and commercial when selling or buying a product.</p>

 Provide an Implementation Conformance Statement pro forma.</h5>
</div>



<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> An <dfn>Implementation Conformance Statement</dfn> (<acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym>) provides information about an implementation to a specification, by presenting in a uniform manner the implemented capabilities (e.g., functions, features) and options as well as limitations of the implementation. An <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> pro forma typically takes the form of a blank questionnaire or checklist for an implementation.Â  It provides the implementer a way to indicate  the features implemented. Think of it as an inventory of what has been implemented.Â  Note that a completed <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> does not indicate conformance of the implementation.Â  Hence, answering âyesâ to indicate a capability is supported does not mean that the capability has been tested.</p>

<p>This Good Practice suggests that the specification itself include an <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> pro forma.Â  Providing an <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> pro forma is conducive to the statement being completed and helps to ensure consistency among completed <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym>es.Â </p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> An <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> pro forma provides a concise summary of a specification, i.e., the capabilities and options defined in the specification as well as any defined subdivisions (e.g., profiles, modules) and conformance designations. The <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> provided with the specification is blank, waiting for the implementer to complete.Â  This blank ICS provides implementers and users a quick overview of features defined in the specification. A completed <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> not only provides information on what has been implemented (mandatory and optional features), but can also be used to document the presence of extensions or any specializations that have been made.Â  A completed <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> provides information useful to facilitate the selection of applicable tests for the particular implementation.Â  However, that is not all.Â  Although the <acronym title="Implementation Conformance Statement">ICS</acronym> content is independent of testing,  associating it with conformance tests makes it an essential piece in the reporting of conformance results (see techniques in <a href="#ics-claim-gp">Good Practice 5</a>).</p>

<h3 id="nature">2.2 Setting Up Ground Rules</h3>

<h4 id="scope">2.2.1 Scope</h4>

<p>The path to a quality specification begins with its scope.Â  It is critical to convey what the specification is about by describing its intent and applicability.Â  As the specification develops, it is a good idea to revisit the scope to make sure it still reflects the intent of the specification or if it needs to be modified.

</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> 
Scope is one of the first sections a reader reads, so it is important to capture their attention and make sure they understand what the specification is about.  It helps to keep the specification content focused.Â It helps reviewers determine when the specification is over-stepping its mandate and offers the possibility for revising the specification while it is in development. It also  helps readers know the limits or boundaries of the specification and whether it is of interest to them.</p>
</div>

<div class="technique">
<h6 id="define-scope-tech">Techniques</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Make the scope easy to find.
<ol>
	<li>Include the scope section in the beginning of the document.</li>
	<li>Make âScopeâ an item in the table of contents.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Write simple, direct statements of fact. Do not include any requirements in the scope section.  Use statements such as âThis documentâ:
<ul>
	<li> â specifies a method ofâ¦.</li>
	<li> â specifies the characteristics ofâ¦.</li>
	<li> â definesâ¦.</li>
	<li> â establishes a system forâ¦.</li>
	<li> â establishes general principles forâ¦.</li>
	<li> â is a guide forâ¦.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> In addition to describing the subject of the specification, address the following to achieve a more complete scope:
<ul>
	<li>Applicability of the specification</li>
	<li>Purpose, objectives, and goals</li>
	<li>Types of products or services (i.e., classes of products) to which the specification applies</li>
	<li>Relationship to other specifications or technologies</li>
	<li>What is not in scope, i.e., what the specification is not about</li>
	<li>Limitations on the application of the specification.</li>

For each feature, the Working Group might seek  early implementation to demonstrate the feature. If early implementations are not available (e.g., due to commercial constraints, <abbr title="Intellectual Property Rights">IPR</abbr>, etc.), it is beneficial to write test cases to illustrate a concept or use case of the technology. This provides a way to to study the interactions between the different parts of the specification and reveal problems. Additionally, these test cases can be incorporated into a test suite.</p>

<h4 id="reference">2.2.3 Normative (and Non-Normative) References</h4>





<p>Rarely written in isolation, a specification inherits from previously defined technologies. It also might set the future of other specifications by defining their base. Thus, it is essential to clearly define the nature of references to previous specifications (normative or informative) and the implications of these references for the future of the technology.</p>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> A specification is rarely developed from scratch: it usually relies on other technologies defined in different specifications.

</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>
For the Working Group, normative references have an immediate benefit: âDo not reinvent the wheel.â Using features  already defined in other documents helps to minimize the size of the specification and to avoid ambiguities by rewriting the same concepts.</p>
<p>Knowing that a part of a specification is based on another technology is a  huge benefit for implementers as it clarifies the implications for  conformance. Normative references may help implementers to minimize their work by using conformant libraries already implemented elsewhere.</p>
<p>More generally, normative references might help readers  understand where the technology is coming from and therefore how to use it in combination with other technologies they may already know.</p>

	<li>When using a specific feature of another specification, use the precise designation, wording of the feature and a unique and precise way to identify this feature in the specification (using the URI to the definition of the feature, using the exact section denomination).</li>
	<li>Use only the meaning defined in the reference; do not interpret or assume intention of the technology, as it may lead to different interpretations depending on the readers.</li>

<p>For the purpose of illustration, the following cases demonstrate some of the problems and implications that may occur for a theoretical technology using the notion of URI or URI references â this example is <strong>not an exhaustive review</strong> of all possible cases. The definition of URI and URI references technology  exists in a specification  called RFC2396 entitled âUniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax.â</p>

<p>Let us create a simple definition and give examples of possible problems that arise from this definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The value of the attribute is a URI as in [RFC2396].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance:</p>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
â¦="http://www.example.org/#foo"
â¦="http://[3ffe:2a00:100:7031::1]/"
â¦="http://666.666.666.666/"
â¦="foo"
â¦="http://www.example.org/~anaÃ¯s-nin"
</pre>

<div class="indiv-example">
<p><strong>Precise designation and reference</strong>: The first example is illegal as the example uses a URI reference as opposed to only a URI; RFC 2396 clearly distinguishes between those constructs. To make the first example a valid construct, the text should have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of the attribute is a URI reference as defined in section 4 of [RFC2396].</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="indiv-example">
<p><strong>Superset of the reference and interpretation</strong>: RFC 2396 does not include support for IPv6 literals;  RFC 2732 introduced the syntax but it does <strong>not</strong> update RFC 2396.

<div class="indiv-example">
<p>As a separate example, any specification that defines the behavior of a class of products that creates XML should address XML 1.1 and anticipate future XML versions. In XSLT, creation of XML is specified by <code>&lt;xsl:output method="xml" version="1.0" /&gt;</code>, and each version of XSLT defines the allowable range of values for the version attribute. Another option is to reference the XML Infoset - for instance, XML Inclusions are compatible both with XML 1.0 and XML 1.1 since they reference normatively the XML Infoset, which is the same for the two versions of XML.</p>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> 
The normative parts of a specification often use technical terms in a
very restricted sense; write down the definitions behind these terms. Use the same phrases to convey the same meaning. Repetition, considered a stylistic error in prose, diminishes ambiguity in a technical specification and lowers the threshold of vocabulary needed to understand the specification.</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> 
English (like any other natural language) is ambiguous, such that a term's interpretation is context dependent. Implementers can achieve interoperability between implementations only if they have the same understanding of the specification; defining the terms used in the normative parts promotes a common understanding that contributes to accurate implementation.</p>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> 
Many specifications define more than one type of conformance, where each type is applicable to a different class of products.

Associate a well-defined label for each different type of conformance.</p>

Having a label associated with each type of conformance helps interoperability, testing, and branding.  It gives implementers a way to identify and discuss their implementations and express the degree to which an implementation has met a  specific set of requirements in the conformance clause.  It gives test developers a meaningful set of requirements to develop tests for and against which to make conformance verdicts.

<li>The imperative style uses the imperative form to convey the
requirement;  guidelines or specifications that need the
reader's involvement often use it. Its weaknesses are that it does not necessarily make
clear <strong>what</strong> needs to conform (since there is no subject), and that the imperative voice may be harder to translate in some languages.</li>

<li>Avoid using language that looks normative (e.g., with RFC 2119 key words) in informative sections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using one of these styles does not preclude using another style in a
different part of the specification, provided the reader is adequately informed. For instance, when defining a language, it is a good idea
to define first its semantics using the descriptive style, and then the
behavior of one (or more) type of implementations using RFC 2119 key words.</p>

<h3 id="variability">2.4 Managing Variability</h3>

<p>Specifications allow for variation between conforming implementations for different reasons, e.g., adaptation to hardware capacities and extensibility.Â  Variability, while it can provide for broader usage of the technology, may impede interoperability.Â  Watch out for excessive variability â that which goes beyond the necessary.Â  Look for a balance between what is needed to allow for flexibility while still achieving the desired interoperability.</p>

<p>This section gives advice on finding the right balance; the reader
will also benefit from reading,  <cite><a href="/TR/spec-variability/">Variability in Specifications</a></cite>
[<a href="#VIS">VIS</a>] which goes into more detail and the analysis of variability.</p>

<div id="subdivide-section">
<h4 id="subdivide">2.4.1 Subdivide.</h4>

<p> Subdividing the technology should be done carefully.Â  Too many divisions complicates conformance and can hinder interoperability by increasing the chances of conflict with other aspects of the specification (e.g., other subdivisions).Â  Be smart when dividing the technology so that the subdivisions provide a positive impact on implementation and interoperability and the subdivisions are not excessive.Â  The benefits of subdividing should outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>Options in specifications provide implementers the freedom to make

  <li>Whether or not to support a well-defined feature.</li>
  <li>Which value or behavior to choose from a well-defined enumerated set of possibilities.</li>
  <li>Implementation-dependent values or features.</li>
</ul>

<p>These choices, also called <dfn>discretionary items,</dfn> give implementers of the technology the opportunity to decide from alternatives when building their applications and tools. They describe or allow optionality of behavior, functionality, parameter values, error handling, etc. They may be considered necessary because of environmental conditions (e.g., hardware limitations or software configuration), locality differences (e.g., language or time zones), dependencies on other technologies, or the need for flexibility.</p>

<p>Although there are perceived benefits to providing optional features, there is also a downside: optional features increase the variations that can exist among
implementations. The greatest way to undo the utility of a specification is with too many optional features. Different implementations may use different combinations of optional features. This makes comparisons between
implementations difficult, complicates conformance testing, and
increases the chance of non-interoperable implementations.</p>


<div class="story">
<h4 id="option-story"><span class="story-label">Story:</span></h4>

<p>A concise <cite>XSLT 1.0</cite> [<a href="#XSLT10">XSLT10</a>] example: the specification grants implementers  separate discretion about all of the following aspects of creating attributes in the output:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Whether to raise an error when the supplied name is not a valid <code>QName</code>.</li>
	<li>Whether to raise an error when  attempting to create an attribute after having created children of the element.</li>
	<li>Whether to raise an error when attempting to create an attribute on a node that is not an element.</li>
	<li>Whether to raise an error when the content of an attribute is not plain text.</li>
	<li>Whether to raise an error when two attribute-sets of the same precedence contain an attribute of the same name.</li>
	<li>Whether to raise an error when attempting to create an attribute directly under the root of a result tree fragment.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>In each case,  one prescribed behavior exists for an implementation that chooses not to raise an error. Thus, the six separate binary choices give rise to 64 different possible behaviors for conformant processors. Typically, an implementer would be content to make a more global choice about raising errors when there is an attempt to create non-well-formed XML results.</p>

<h4 id="extensions">2.4.3 Extensibility and Extensions</h4>

<p>To accommodate changes in technology and information on the Web, a
specification can be designed for extensibility. A specification is
extensible when it provides a mechanism to allow an external party to create
extensions. <dfn>Extensions</dfn> incorporate additional features beyond those defined in the specification. However, extensions can compromise
interoperability if there are too many differences between implementations.
Features specifically designed to allow new functionality mitigate the impact of extensions. These features provide a âstandard way
to be non-standardâ by including hooks, conformance rules, or other
mechanisms by which new functionality may be added in a conforming way, designated as an <dfn>extensibility mechanism</dfn>.</p>


<div id="likehood-extension">

<h5 id="likehood-extension-principle"><span class="principle-label">Requirement 11:</span>
Address extensibility.</h5>
</div>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> Extensions might be encouraged or discouraged by the Working Group. There is a benefit to addressing the value or danger of using extensibility for the given technology. Formalizing the position of the Working Group in a clearly defined section and prose  removes ambiguities for the specification users about the possibility of developing extensions or not. This section should at least address whether the specification is extensible or not.</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> Implementers will most likely want to extend functionalities if their specific needs are not defined in the specification. Defining clearly how to hook extended functionalities  into conforming implementations  helps ensure  consistency in the definition of extensions. This leads to predictable handling of extensions and minimizes issues such as interoperability problems, minimal support, and harmonious future development.</p>

<p>The Working Group may consider that the technology is complete, self-sufficient and does not need to be extensible. In this case, it is necessary to write this clearly in the specification and to explain why the technology is not considered extensible. The reason might be just for the social benefit of the community to ensure a maximum interoperability.</p>

<div class="practice">
<h5 id="extensions-prohibited-gp"><span class="practice-label">Good Practice 18:</span>
If extensibility is allowed, define an extension mechanism.</h5>
</div>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> Extensions increase variability between implementations. Defining a mechanism  helps to ensure the definition of extensions are  consistent. Consistent extension definitions lead to predictable handling of extensions, including the ability to take appropriate actions (e.g., do the extension, ignore, or take a fallback behavior). </p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>  By planning for extensions and designing a specification for extensibility, there is less chance that extensions will interfere with conformance to the base specification and a better chance at achieving interoperability. Conversely, there may be areas in a specification that would not benefit from extensibility and extensions are strictly forbidden (e.g., permissible characters in <cite>XML 1.0</cite> names for elements and attributes [<a href="#XML10">XML10</a>], most of the built-in data types in <cite>XML Schema Part 2</cite> [<a href="#XML-SCHEMA-1">XML-SCHEMA-2</a>]). This is an example of strict conformance. Conformance of an implementation that employs only the requirements and/or functionality defined in the specification and no more defines <dfn>strict conformance</dfn> .</p>

<p>Extension mechanisms designed into a specification:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a stable, useful framework to manage the rapid pace of
    technological change.</li>
  <li>Reduce the chances that extensions will interfere with conformance and
    increasing the chances for achieving interoperability.</li>
  <li>Provide the ability to âtest-driveâ new functionality that may
    migrate into future specifications.</li>
  <li>Enable implementers to include functionality that they consider a customer requirement.</li>
</ul>

<div class="technique">
<h6 id="extensions-prohibited-tech">Techniques</h6>
<p>Technology and
application needs  dictate the best strategy for enabling
extensibility.</p>

<p>Designing for extensibility can become complicated. Points to
consider that can affect design decisions include, but are definitely not limited to, the following topics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the use of extensions in the conformance section.</li>	
  <li>Provide a well-defined template that implementers can use to create extensions.</li>
  <li>Verify that the extension mechanism prevents the creation of extensions that conflict with the semantics of the specification (see <a href="#breaking-conformance-gp">Good Practice 19</a>).</li>
  <li>When needed, define the scope of extensions (e.g., are extensions authorized only for certain parts of the technology?).</li>
  <li>As an example, make a fake extension showing implementers the right way to create an extension.</li>
  <li>Indicate whether extensions interact with other extensions.</li>
  <li>Indicate whether extensions may be combined or are mutually exclusive.</li>
  <li>Indicate whether extensions apply to a specification's profiles or modules and not to the core part of the specification.</li>
  <li>Avoid âuntested hooksâ: if an extensibility mechanism is defined, make sure it is well tested during the implementation phase. Experience has shown that untested extensibility just does not work.</li>

<h4 id="deprecation">2.4.4 Deprecation</h4>

<p>The need for deprecation comes about when there are features (e.g., a function argument, element, attribute) defined in the specification that have become outdated and are being phased out, usually in favor of a specified replacement. It may mean for instance that the feature is still there and functional, but:</p>
<ol>
	<li>There is a better way of achieving the same thing and the Working Group prefers that this better way be used, or </li>
	<li>The feature is unused and the Working Group wants to clean up the specification and eventually remove the feature. </li>
</ol>
<p>From a user point of view, a deprecated feature is one that should not be used anymore, since it may be removed from future versions of the specification. Deprecated features are no longer recommended for use and may become obsolete and no longer defined in future versions of the specification.</p>

Define how each class of products handles each deprecated feature.</h5>
</div>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> By deprecating a feature, the Working Group indicates its desire that the feature disappear from a future version of the specification.  The motivation may be to convert an old feature to a newer one or to remove an old, dangerous, redundant or undesirable feature.  Regardless of the reason, it is important to define the effect this has on implementations that may encounter this feature (e.g., consumer products such as user agents or producer products such as authoring tools).  How will the user agents or producer products tolerate use of the deprecated feature?  Will they signal an error or a warning? Typically, use of a deprecated feature would not affect a consumer (e.g. user agent), while a producer (e.g. authoring tool) should issue a warning.</p>
</div>


<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>  Defining how deprecated features are handled provides a smoother transition for the users of the specified technology and ensures more consistency of the behavior across implementations. It is also particularly important for implementations that need to support different versions of the specification.</p>
<p>For instance, a specification may require that an implementation
supports both the features of the new and the old specifications, or it may
suggest a conversion mechanism.</p>

Explain how to avoid using a deprecated feature.</h5>
</div>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> Deprecating a feature implies that its  use is discouraged, often because there is a better technique available to achieve the same result. For each deprecated feature, it is necessary to explain how implementers and users can avoid using it. It might be helpful to give additional information providing insight into the motivation for the deprecation.</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> Examples and information about each deprecated feature  help users  smoothly evolve toward the new version of the technology and  understand its benefits. This enables a faster adoption of the technology.</p>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> Identifying obsolete features gives a clear message to users and implementers that those obsolete features are forbidden and not part of the specification anymore. This  helps to  avoid the creation of documents that mix the old and new techniques and that would be invalid.</p>
	<p>It also helps avoid name clashing. When creating an extension to a technology, implementers are likely to use a syntax token for their extended features name. Providing the name of obsolete features  helps implementers avoid using the names of previous features that are now obsolete.</p>

<h4 id="error">2.4.5 Error Handling</h4>

<div id="error-handling">
<div class="practice">
<h5 id="error-handling-gp"><span class="practice-label">Good Practice 23:</span>
Define an error handling mechanism.</h5>
</div>

<div class="meaning">
<p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> 
For each class of products  affected by an error 
condition, address  error handling. For instance, 
for a language, address what effect an error (be it syntactic or
semantic) in the input has on a processor of this language. 
For a protocol, address how a party to this protocol should behave  when
a bogus message is received. For an <abbr title="Application Program Interface">A.P.I.</abbr>, indicate what exceptions are raised.</p>
</div>

<div class="care">
<p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>
There are many reasons a system may fail; to make a technology reliable,
it is crucial to define how it should react to bogus input or conditions.
Defining error handling also makes it possible for a user of the
technology to react appropriately to the error condition.
</p>
</div>


<div class="technique">
<h6 id="error-handling-tech">Techniques</h6>
<p>Different methodologies exist to handle errors in a technology:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identifying failure points and binding them with  well-known error messages allows better recovery and or reporting of these failures. This methodology is particularly useful in protocols.</li>
	<li>The technology can specify the handling of syntax errors (content that cannot be parsed) and semantic errors (meaningless content)  separately or together.</li>
        <li>One should keep in mind that extensibility may need new syntax tokens  (see <a href="#define-error-gp">Good Practice 20</a>). 

        </li>
	<li>Try to limit the number of types of error defined by the specification. Also, processing errors of the same kind in the same way allows for greater interoperability.</li>

<h2 id="beyond-conformance">3. Beyond Conformance</h2>


<p>As all editors know, the work is not finished when the writing is completed. In fact, various reviews and checks of all W3C documents are required prior to their publication and advancement. In addition to the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C Process Document</a></cite> [<a href="#PROCESS-DOC">PROCESS-DOC</a>] and <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a></cite> [<a href="#PUBRULES">PUBRULES</a>] and before Last Call reviews, other techniques improve the quality and clarity of the document. Many of these techniques can be an integrated part of the specification development. Ensuring a quality document prior to external reviews can save time and energy in that the Working Group may get fewer comments and issues to resolve.</p>


<div id="check">
<h3 id="practice-principle">3.1 Define an internal publication and review process.</h3>

<div class="story">
<h4 id="cr-story"><span class="story-label">Story:</span></h4>

<p>In 2004, QA Working Group documents entered Candidate Recommendation prior to a thorough
quality review, resulting in a huge number of issues to resolve and an
eventual retreat back to Working Draft for major revisions. Many of the
comments could have been prevented, such as inconsistency and incompleteness of the document (e.g., links to supplementary materials that did not exist or were not complete, overlapping and conflicting requirements), undefined terminology, and unimplementable requirements.</p>
</div>


<p>Define (formally or not) an internal process for reviewing and developing new parts of the specifications, and how they appear in W3C technical reports. </p>

<p>The more that the specification work is organized,  the more chances there are to move smoothly across W3C process, and to have a better final product. Setting up an internal publication/review process avoids recurrent errors in the document and allows wider participation in the editorial work, making it possible to develop the specification faster.</p>

<p>Make it fun to do quality control on the specification by providing tools and templates. For instance, at the start of work on the specification, create guidelines to help Working Group participants submit proposed text for the specification.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 id="check-ex">Examples</h4>
<div class="indiv-example"><p><cite>QA Specification Guidelines</cite>: For the Good Practices and Requirements of <cite>QA Specification Guidelines</cite>, a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-qa-wg/2004Jun/0023.html">template and a method</a> were developed to make the editing of each part easy for the QA Working Group to discuss and easy for the editor to incorporate in the final document.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="review">
<h3 id="review-gp">3.2 Do a systematic and thorough review.</h3>

<p>Not only should the Working Group review each part of the technology before publication, it should also review it during the editing phase. That helps the Working Group identify missing pieces, spelling mistakes, ambiguities and dependencies. When a well-defined review process is established inside the Working Group, reviews during the editing phase are easy to accomplish.</p>

<p>A Working Draft  published with incomplete or very raw sections will probably cause the Working Group to receive many comments. At best, the Working Group will spend much time answering them. At worst, the incomplete text will go unnoticed and appear in the final Recommendation. So when publishing a version with incomplete sections, make clear:</p>
<ul>
	<li>That those sections are incomplete.</li>
	<li>The group's expectations. Does the group want comments and contributions, or should reviewers ignore these sections?</li>
</ul>

</ul>	
</div>
<ol>
	<li>Create a simple and light review process. For instance, establish a team, where each person focuses on a different aspect of the specification's correctness.</li>
	<li>Organize at least one review cycle before publication (more if possible).</li>
	<li>Organize the review by topic and expertise. For example, each participant can check a different part of the specification. Or organize the review process by expertise - the grammarian checks for consistency, grammar, spelling and readability; the test builder checks requirements for precision and implementability; the conformance expert checks that conformance criteria exist.</li>

Upon completion of a Requirement or Good Practice, its text was circulated to the entire Working Group for comments. At the same time, the Chair assigned review of that text to a specific Working Group participant.  This practice ensured that at least one person in the Working Group had responsibility for that text, and that it would not fall through the cracks.</p></div>
</div>

<div id="other-topics">
<h3 id="address-other-topics">3.3 Accessibility, Internationalization, and Device Independence Considerations</h3>

<p>First and foremost, W3C specifications need to frame and define
technologies that meet the requirements of the particular
deliverable, fulfill the charter of the Working Group, and advance
W3C's mission to extend the exchange of
information through the Web to everyone. Thus, accessibility, internationalization and device independence are
general requirements that must be considered in the specification of
all Web technologies. (Specification developers should consult the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">technical reports index</a> for an up-to-date profile of W3C publications in all areas.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative</a> (<acronym title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</acronym>) pursues Web accessibility for people with disabilities through technology, guidelines, tools, education and outreach, and research and development. <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</a></cite> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">WAI home page</a> are helpful starting points. Some suggestions on user interface formats are in the Working
Draft <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xag">XML Accessibility Guidelines</a> [<a href="#XAG">XAG</a>] (work in progress).</p>

<p>Similarly, Working Groups should make sure the technologies they define are
compatible with internationalization (i.e., not specific to a
particular language or culture). The <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/">W3C internationalization (<acronym title="Internationalization">I18N</acronym>) home page</a> is a good place to start. Addressing
internationalization in a specification ensures that the
defined formats and protocols do not create barriers for languages,
writing systems, character codes, and other local conventions employed
by end users of the technology. For information on interoperable text manipulation, refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/">Character Model for the World Wide Web</a> [<a href="#CHARMOD">CHARMOD</a>].</p>

<p>Finally, a W3C specification should support device
independence to the maximum extent possible and appropriate, to allow people of the greatest
diversity to interact with it. The benefit of
addressing device independence is the increased
likelihood that a specification and its implementations can be accessed from any device, in any
context, by anyone. A good place to start is the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/di/">W3C device independence home page</a>.</p>

<p>A Working Group should designate participants to monitor the application of accessibility, internationalization and device independence to their
specifications at the earliest point possible. These participants can be the points of
contact with the relevant W3C Activities and can seek feedback on their group's
adopted solutions.</p>

<h2 id="conformance">4. Conformance to This Document</h2>

<p>The keywords âMUSTâ, âMUST NOTâ, âREQUIREDâ, âSHALLâ, âSHALL NOTâ, âSHOULDâ, âSHOULD NOTâ, âRECOMMENDEDâ, âMAYâ, and âOPTIONALâ are used as defined in RFC 2119 [<a href="#RFC2119">RFC2119</a>] in this conformance clause. Occurrences of these words in bold lowercase have normative implications. A specific markup has been added to the text.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-criteria">4.1 Conformance Criteria</h3>

<p>The conformance model of the QA Framework: Specification Guidelines is very simple.Â </p>

<ul>
	<li>It applies to one class of products â W3C technical reports, with a strong focus on normative specifications. Non-W3C specifications <strong class="rfc2119">may</strong> also utilize it.</li>
	<li>It is monolithic â no modules, levels or profiles are defined.</li>
	<li>It has only one conformance label, called <dfn>Specification Guidelines conformant specification</dfn>.</li>
	<li>It has <strong class="rfc2119">optional</strong> features, but the <strong class="rfc2119">optional</strong> features do not affect conformance.</li>
	<li>It allows extensions, but the extensions do not affect conformance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The conformance requirements of this document are found in the Requirements and in the Good Practices.Â  The Requirements are written in the imperative voice and denote mandatory conformance requirements.Â  They are equivalent to the familiar MUST statements in the RFC2119 style.Â  In addition to Requirements, this document contains Good Practices.Â  Good Practices use the same imperative voice, but are <strong class="rfc2119">optional</strong>.Â  They are equivalent to SHOULD or RECOMMENDED statements in the RFC2119 style.Â Â  Their implementation or non-implementation does not affect conformance to this Specification Guidelines document, but implementation of as many as possible is recommended, because the quality of the specification will benefit.</p>

<p>For a specification to be Specification Guidelines conformant, all Requirements <strong class="rfc2119">must</strong> be implemented.</p>

<p>One way to satisfy the Requirements and Good Practices is to implement one or more of the suggested techniques given for each Requirement and Good Practice.Â  Note that this is not the only way to satisfy the Requirement or Good Practice.Â  An implementation conformance statement (ICS)  helps track implemented Requirements and Good Practices.Â  It takes the <a href="specgl-ics.html">form of a checklist</a> [<a href="#QA-SPEC-ICS">QA-SPEC-ICS</a>].Â  If all the Requirements are checked on the ICS as being satisfied, then conformance can be <a href="#specgl-claim">claimed as detailed below</a>.Â </p>

<h3 id="normative-parts">4.2 Normative Parts</h3>

      criteria, or conditions to be satisfied by an implementation in order to
      claim conformance.</dd>

   <dt id="deprecated-def">deprecated feature</dt>
   <dd>	An existing feature that has become outdated
	and is in the process of being phased out,
	usually in favor of a specified replacement.

	for use and may cease to exist in future
	versions of the specification.
</dd>

  <dt id="dov-def">dimensions of variability (DoV)</dt>
    <dd>The ways in which different products that are conformant to a
      specification may vary among themselves.</dd>

  <dt id="discretionary-items-def">discretionary item</dt>
    <dd>Deliberate and explicit grants of discretion by the specification to
      the implementations that describe or allow optionality of behavior,

      technology.</dd>



<dt id="implementation-def">implementation</dt>
    <dd>An implementation is a realization of a technology in accordance to the principles defined in the technical specifications for this technology. This implementation can be a document, product, application, process, service, system, or other entity.</dd>

<dt id="ics-def">implementation conformance statement  (ICS)</dt>
<dd>A questionnaire or checklist for providing information about an implementation to a specification, by presenting in a uniform manner the implemented capabilities (e.g., functions, features) and options as well as limitations of the implementation. </dd>

	<dt id="informative-def">informative</dt>
	<dd>Text in a specification whose purpose is informational or assistive  in the understanding or use of the specification, and which contains no  conformance requirements or test assertions.</dd>


   <dt id="level-def">level</dt>
   <dd>A technology subset that is one of a hierarchy of nested subsets, ranging from minimal or core functionality to full or complete functionally.</dd>

   <dt id="module-def">module</dt>

  <dt id="specification">specification</dt>
  <dd>Document that prescribes requirements to be fulfilled by a product, process, or service.</dd>

  <dt id="strict-conformance-def">strict conformance</dt>
    <dd>Conformance of an implementation that employs only the requirements
      and/or functionality defined in the specification and no more (i.e., no
      extensions to the specification are implemented).</dd>

  <dt id="test-assertion-def">test assertion</dt>
    <dd>A measurable or testable statement of behavior, action, or condition. It is derived from the specification's requirements.</dd>
