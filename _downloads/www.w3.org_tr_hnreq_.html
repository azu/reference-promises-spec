      <p>This document lists the design goals and requirements that potential <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> recommendations should support in order to enable access to services and content provided by home network devices on other devices, including the discovery and playback of content available to those devices, both from services such as traditional broadcast media and internet based services but also from the home network.</p>

      <p>Recommendations in this document are the result of discussion in the Home Network Task Force of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/">Web and TV Interest Group</a>. The Home Network Task Force believes that most of these recommendations listed in this document will be refined and addressed within the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">Device APIs Working Group</a>, as part of its work on a devices and services discovery API standard. In particular, while the Home Network Task Force may continue to discuss areas of home networking scenarios that have not already been raised in this document, it does not anticipate further work on the scenarios and requirements highlighted in this document within the Web and TV Interest Group.</p>

<h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>There is an increasing amount of personal and streaming (broadcast) content that users would like to be able to access from any device in the home (personal computers, tablets, mobile phones, TVs and others).</p>
      
      <p>Growing numbers of consumer electronic devices such as TVs and mobile phones can access internet based services as well as content originating from both home network devices and broadcast services. For example, many commercial video providers currently provide the ability for a user to access content stored on a home network device (e.g. a <abbr title="digital video recorder">DVR</abbr>) or accessed via a network connected <abbr title="set-top box">STB</abbr>. A home network content discovery and control protocol is used by the <abbr title="digital video recorder">DVR</abbr> and <abbr title="set-top box">STB</abbr> to provide this access, through a native user interface, to other devices in the home (e.g. PCs, TVs).</p>

      <p>The dominant scenario today is for a home network device to both discover and playback home network content. Examples of these devices may include personal computers or connected televisions. This is commonly referred to as a 2-Box model. An emerging scenario is for the content discovery and control to take place on a separate handheld device, such as a smartphones or tablets. The handheld device then instructs a content player (e.g. a TV) to playback content from a content server (e.g. a <abbr title="digital video recorder">DVR</abbr>). This is referred to as the 3-Box model.</p>

      <p>In all use cases, security mechanisms are made available to protect user privacy and content owners’ rights.</p>

      <p>There is no standardized way to build a web application that can use content discovery and control protocols to access the content on other devices in the home network. This document lists the design goals and requirements that future <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> recommendations need to address in order to address this problem. This would enable content providers to deliver web applications to any conforming device in order to enhance and harmonize the user experience.</p>

<h2><span class="secno">3. </span>Terminology</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn id="dfn-programme">programme</dfn> (program)</dt>
        <dd>A programme (program) comprises a single period of audio visual content. It is usually expected to be labeled in content directories or television programme guides as a single entity. This might include an episode of a television programme, a radio programme, or a movie.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-device">device</dfn></dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, a device is any piece of equipment connected to the <a href="#dfn-home-network" class="internalDFN">home network</a>. Note that this is a generic term that also includes <a href="#dfn-television" class="internalDFN">television</a> (defined below).</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-television">television</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A <a href="#dfn-device" class="internalDFN">device</a> that presents <a href="#dfn-programme" class="internalDFN">programme</a> content from a variety of sources - such as received via broadcast (cable, satellite, terrestrial), on-demand streaming services, or streamed from other devices in the home (e.g. PVR). Within the scope of this document, it is presumed that a television is connected to the <a href="#dfn-home-network" class="internalDFN">home network</a>.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-service">service</dfn></dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, a service is any functionality available on a <a href="#dfn-device" class="internalDFN">device</a>, such as the ability to play back audio/video content, record content and print documents</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-document">document</dfn></dt>
        <dd>An individual resource that adheres to a certain content type, ranging from short static documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia. For simplicity, terms such as shown, displayed, and visible might sometimes be used when referring to the way a document is rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to imply a visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other media in equivalent ways.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-application">application</dfn></dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, the term “application” refers to a collection of documents (not necessarily delivered over HTTP) which use server-side or client-side processing to provide a &quot;native application&quot;-like experience within a Web browser or other kinds of Web run-time. Applications may include locally executable elements of interactivity and persistent state. Note that locally stored applications like <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Widgets [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-WIDGETS">WIDGETS</a></cite>] are intended to be covered by this definition.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-home-network">home network</dfn></dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, the term “home network” refers to the networking infrastructure that facilitates Internet Protocol communications between devices within the home. This may range from a single legacy IPv4 subnet to multiple IPv4 subnets and dual stack or IPv6 environments and will typically (but not always) be connected to the Internet.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-content-item">content item</dfn></dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, the term “content item” refers to metadata describing or more binary versions of media. The media described by an item may either be stored or streamed. A single content item may refer to multiple media binaries that represent different formats for the content being described.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-channel-item">channel item</dfn></dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, the term “channel item” refers to an “item” describing a streaming source. A channel item may contain metadata describing the channel source such as channel number, distribution network, etc. A channel may not be available on the home network, i.e. the “channel item” may refer to a channel that can only be locally tuned. In these cases “channel item” metadata will not provide network addressing information (URLs) to connect to the channel source.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-epg-item">epg item</dfn> (electronic programming guide)</dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, the term “epg item” refers to an item that may be available with some defined time range. An “epg item” may contain metadata describing the channel source for the content and the time range the channel media will be available.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-record-schedule">record schedule</dfn> (item)</dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, the term “record schedule” refers to an item which contains metadata describing a request to a network recording service to record content. “Record schedule items” may include: simple time/duration requests, recording of a specific <a href="#dfn-epg-item" class="internalDFN">epg item</a>, and recording dynamically selected <a title="epg item" href="#dfn-epg-item" class="internalDFN">epg items</a> based metadata properties of desired content. “Record schedule items” additionally include metadata describing the status of the recording request.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-record-task">record task</dfn> (item)</dt>
        <dd>For the purposes of this document, the term “record task item” refers to an item which contains metadata describing a pending or completed network recording operation. “Record task items” are created by a network recording service and allow network record service clients to control pending recording operations. Additionally, “record task items” include metadata describing the status of the recording request and the identity of <a title="content item" href="#dfn-content-item" class="internalDFN">content items</a> that represent the results of network recording operations.</dd>

          <dd>
            <p>An application moving across HNTF user agents in a decentralized situation (local application, without a server).</p>
            <p>A radio service is split into a radio application which resides typically on a HiFi, TV, personal music player or computer, and a radio controller application which resides on a device with intuitive interaction capability such as a phone, computer or tablet. The radio application is implemented as a document exposing a service interface on the network, and has a state that needs preserving if the document is migrated. The radio controller application is a pure interface, and does not have its own state.</p>
            <p>The radio application does not have a visual interface. The radio application exposes a service of type JCDsRadioApp with seven possible messages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>setURI(radioStationURI, radioName),</li>
              <li>play(),</li>
              <li>stop(),</li>
              <li>setVolume(n),</li>
              <li>getURI(),</li>
              <li>getRadioName(),</li>
              <li>getPlayState(),</li>
              <li>getVolume().</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The radio application is running on a TV set.</p>
            <p>The radio controller application has a visual interface, comprising:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a button to choose the radio station.</li>
              <li>a play button.</li>
              <li>a stop button.</li>
              <li>a label for the current radio station name.</li>
              <li>a volume bar to display the current volume.</li>
              <li>two buttons to increase and decrease the volume.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The radio controller application is running on a smartphone. The radio controller application looks for a service called JCDsRadioApp by using the HNTF discovery mechanism, then establishes a connection with the above application. The radio controller application gets the radio name, volume, play state of the radio application and displays that information.</p>
            <p>The stage is now set.</p>
            <p>The user wants to move from the TV in the main room to the computer in her office:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the HNTF user agent on the TV, the user requests to migrate the radio application.</li>
              <li>The TV HNTF UA looks for other HNTF UAs on the network, by discovering service &quot;HNTFUserAgentv1.0&quot;.</li>
              <li>The result of the discovery is a list of HNTF UAs: the one on the phone, the one on the computer, possibly other ones.</li>
              <li>The user selects the HNTF UA running on the computer.</li>
              <li>The TV HNTF UA sends the message migrate(appURI, contextURI) to the computer HNTF UA.</li>
              <li>The computer HNTF UA requests the appURI to get the radio application, then requests the contextURI, which contains all the information needed to place the radio application in the same state it was in on the TV.</li>
              <li>The computer HNTF UA loads the radio application, then the context. Loading the context first sets the volume to half and the station to &quot;Jazz&quot;.</li>
              <li>Then the computer HNTF UA exposes a service of type JCDsRadioApp.</li>
              <li>Then the smartphone HNTF UA understands that its connection to the radio application in the TV is down, so it starts again a discovery of service type JCDsRadioApp. It finds one on the computer HNTF UA, and sends a connection request.</li>
              <li>The computer HNTF UA receives a connection request from the device mentioned in the migration context as formerly connected. It accepts the connection without requiring a user validation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>End of migration.</p>
            <p>When moving the radio document, the following needs to be preserved:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the service needs to be restarted and exposed on the new device</li>
              <li>the connection to the (same) radio controller needs to be reestablished</li>
              <li>the radio needs to be playing the same station, with the same volume, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another possible example is a multi-user game, e.g. with lots of players sending location and activity information about their character/cars. Upon migration, the game state needs to be transferred to the new device, and the connections to other players need to be reestablished.</p>

            <p>An application spawning other applications on other devices and communicating with them: e.g. the TV set receives and renders an application implementing some voting; the application discovers multiple phones in the home, proposes to activate voting interfaces on each of the viewers' phones, communicates with the voting interfaces, collates votes and sends them back to the channel's voting service.</p>
            <p>Possible implementation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The TV receives a connected TV application for voting, which starts automatically.</li>
              <li>The application exposes a service on the HN to collect votes and forward them to the TV channel.</li>
              <li>The application discovers personal interactive devices (phones and tablets for our case) running the HNTF document UA which exposes a recognizable service.</li>
              <li>The application sends a <i>suggest</i> message with a URL to a voting interface.
              </li><li> Willing users accept the suggested migration and their UA loads the voting interface.
              </li><li> The voting interface document loads and discovers and binds to the vote collecting service.
              </li><li> The user votes
              </li><li> The voting interface document sends a <i>vote</i> message to the vote collecting service.
              </li><li> The vote collecting service exposed by the TV application receives the <i>vote</i> message and forwards them for a certain voting period.
              </li><li> At the end of the show (or of the voting period), the application is killed by the TV system, so the voting collection service disappears.
              </li><li> Seeing the voting collection service disappear, the voting interfaces may shut down.
            </li></ul>
            <p>This use case does not require new technology, but reuses technology required by other use cases. Technologies required by other use cases are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the ability to discover</li>
              <li>the ability to expose a service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This use case requires:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the HNTF UAs to implement a service which could be called &quot;HNTF service&quot;, so that documents can discover other &quot;HNTF UAs&quot;</li>
              <li>the HNTF service to include a &quot;suggest&quot; message telling the UA to please render a document given by URL</li>
              <li>maybe the HNTF service to include a message allowing a document to determine its capabilities, to be able to segregate between devices appropriate for voting or not.</li>

            <p>As there are more devices in the home, some generic and some task-specific, and with varying capabilities (including different UI methods), there is a growing need to spread an application across different devices to achieve service distribution. But the service usually &quot;enters&quot; the home network through one particular device. The service running entirely on the initial device, as part of other use cases, can discover its environment and determine that other devices could meaningfully contribute to the quality of experience. From then on, the service needs to send part of &quot;itself&quot; to other devices.</p>

            <p>An application exposes a service on the home network. In order to allow this with some technologies, it may be necessary for the HNTF user agent to advertise itself on the HN as a device. For example, an application rendered on a connected TV has access to the connected TV API for EPG information. Other devices on the HN do not have access to this information. The application implements a service exposing the EPG information and makes it discoverable by other devices.</p>
            <p>Possible implementation:</p>
            <ul>

            <p>An API, or service, for simplified control of key functionality of television devices, including those with integrated broadcast receivers and limited or no media streaming capabilities. The application defines its own user interface, independent of the user interface of the television device.</p>
            <p>Application developers would benefit from a simplified API or services that provide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A single unified directory of programmes that a given rendering device (e.g. television display) is able to obtain and play. The application does not have to check, for itself, across multiple sources of content and for any issues of codec, container format, and transport protocol compatibility.</li>
              <li>A single simple method for requesting a programme or channel to be presented by a rendering device, irrespective of the above factors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is also desirable to be able to control other common aspects of television functionality through the same API.</p>
            <p>The target of the API would be a processing engine on the home network. For a Javascript API this processing engine could be incorporated into the user agent. Alternatively, it could be implemented by any other device on the home network, including the television device itself. For the latter case, the user agent must be able to discover and communicate with the processing engine in order to execute the functions of the API.</p>
            <p>The processing engine may, when appropriate, utilize existing home networking protocols to perform its function. For example: it may use UPnP AV services to discover and stream content.</p>
            <p>Scenario 1: Basic programme guide application: The application uses the API to perform the following tasks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The application sends a request to discover television devices on the home network</li>
              <li>The application sends a request to ask for the identity of the programme currently being presented on the television, and the source (e.g. television channel)</li>
              <li>The application sends a request to retrieve basic programme metadata (title, description, start and end times) and displays this for the user</li>
              <li>The application sends a request to retrieve a list of sources (e.g. channels) of programmes that can be displayed on the television</li>
              <li>The application sends a request to retrieve a list of programmes, and their basic metadata for those sources for presentation to the user</li>
              <li>The application sends a request to cause a given channel or programme be played on the television.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Extension to scenario 1: Control of other television functions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The application can send a request to change the volume of the television</li>
              <li>The application can enable or disable accessibility features such as subtitles or audio-description</li>
              <li>The application can request to seek (jump to a different time point) within the programme being played</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scenario 2: A web site with material supporting a particular programme wants to be able to offer to play the programme on a television if it is available. A possible interaction (via the API):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The application sends a request to discover television devices on the home network</li>
              <li>The application makes a request to query if a specific programme is available to the television. If it is available, the application offers the choice to the user to display it.</li>
              <li>If the user accepts, the application requests that programme be played on the television.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of the interactions described should be ideally achievable a single call to an API or service method.</p>

            <p>Application developers will benefit from having a single simple API that provides a unified interface to this functionality, irrespective of the means by which the programme is being delivered to, or played by, the television device.</p>
            <p>The application is running on a different device from where the programme is being played. This could be a laptop, mobile phone, tablet, etc. Both devices are on the same home network. The device playing the programme may be a television or other media rendering device. The programme being played may be being obtained by a variety of different means:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>from a live broadcast via an integrated tuner</li>
              <li>playback from local storage (e.g. a Personal Video Recorder device)</li>
              <li>streaming from another device on the home network</li>
              <li>streaming from an on-demand internet service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The target of the API would be a processing engine on the home network. For a Javascript API this processing engine could be incorporated into the user agent.

            </ul>

As the programme progresses, the slideshow automatically moves onto the correct slide for any given point in the programme. If it is possible to seek within the programme timeline (because the programme is not being watched from a live broadcast), the user can use the application to jump to a different point in the presentation and the television will also seek to the corresponding segment of the programme.</p>

            <p>This use case is a specialization of the use case Time Synchronisation (see <a href="#u12.-time-synchronization" class="sectionRef">section 5.12 U12. Time Synchronization</a>)</p>
            <p>An application should be able to synchronize the presentation of its own content with a high degree of accuracy to the timeline of a programme being played on a television or other home media rendering device. The level of accuracy should be sufficient to achieve 'lip-sync' between audio and video (typically within 1 to 2 video frames or tens of milliseconds).</p>
            <p>In addition to the functions described in the Time Synchronisation use case; the API used by the application should be able to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>report an estimate of the timing synchronism accuracy that is achievable</li>
              <li>provide synchronization to within lip-sync accuracy if all devices involved support it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The processing engine that implements the API may utilize existing home networking protocols to achieve the required accuracy. A likely necessary component will be the synchronization of clocks between the television or media rendering device and the device on which the application is running. Possible protocols that might be used to achieve this include: Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588-2002) [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-IEEE1588">IEEE1588</a></cite>], IEEE 802.1AS [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-IEEE802-1AS">IEEE802-1AS</a></cite>], UPnP Precision Time Synchronization [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-UPNP-AVT3">UPNP-AVT3</a></cite>].</p>
            <p>Applications will benefit if the API presents a simple unified set of functions such that the application does not need know which protocols are being used.</p>
            <p>Scenario: An application plays alternative audio that is time synchronized to a programme that the user is watching. The synchronization is sufficiently accurate to maintain 'lip-sync' between the alternative audio and the programme video. The alternative audio may be delivered to the application independently of the television device - such as via a direct stream from a broadcaster's internet based server.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Implementation examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For the local discovery, the HTML5 browser implements UPnP Discovery to provide the generic discovery API to find applications on the same IP sub-network</li>
              <li>For the message exchange, the HTML5 browser implements the extended WebSocket protocol and APIs for bi-directional communications</li>
              <li>The HTML5 browser should implement some mechanism to confirm the user consensus to permit the device discovery and message exchanges for the applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional comments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The above user scenarios are examples. As long as the message exchange API is service/application agnostic, many rich user experience can be realized as the open web platform does</li>
            </ul>

          <dt>Motivation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The “Local Link” enables applications to exchange message, e.g. String, Blob, via the local network directly. Without the “local Link”, the applications which are running on different devices can in-directly communicate via a service on the Internet. But, the “Local Link” has the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adhoc: Without any syndication of services, the applications provided by different services can communicate each other's in ad-hoc. Also, all devices are not required to be bound to the same service. This is a kind of service mash-up using multiple devices</li>
              <li>Efficient: A large size of files can be transferred between devices via high bandwidth local network connection.</li>
              <li>Off-line: Even if the Internet access is not available, the applications can still communicate</li>
              <li>User-centric: Users can easily recognize which devices communicate. Only devices on the same network are listed and the communications of different user device are based on the user consent</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are some standards of local discovery, e.g. UPnP, Bonjour, WS-Discovery, but there is no standard of the JavaScript API which enables communications between Web applications in the manner of application/service agnostic.</p>
            <p>What needs to be standardized:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Type of use case: Generic APIs</li>
              <li>General service discovery and messaging APIs should be standardized</li>
              <li>Network protocols for the APIs should be specified</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>

          <dt>Dependencies</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Any other use cases related to the local IP network discovery since the discovery is also application/service agnostic</p>

            <p>Detailed steps for &quot;Tune and play live programs from a Home Network Media Server capable of streaming live content&quot;:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Web page formats an action request to determine root container(s) for Channel Lineup metadata on the selected Home Network device.<br />
              Notes:
              <ul>
                <li>Multiple Channel Lineup containers may represent either an aggregate of multiple channel sources (Broadcast, Cable, Satellite) or selected channel sources (“Favorite Channels” for instance).</li>
                <li>Channel Lineup containers contain Channel Items which are metadata bundles of channel related properties. Some example of channel properties are: Channel Name, Channel Number, Channel Icon, Channel Preview Stream.</li>
                <li>A Channel Item contains metadata describing one or more URLs which stream the channel's binary content. Access to one of these URL implies any tuning operations necessary to make the requested channel source available.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Web page formats a channel listing based on Channel Items found. In addition the Web page may construct a subset of available Channel Items based previously stored end-user selections.</li>
              <li>Web page may support a Channel Up/Down notion based on an ordering of channels selected by the end-user of by using metadata properties of the Channel Items (Channel Number, Channel Name, etc.)</li>
              <li>Web page will typically offer the end-user the ability to select a channel for playback. The Web page will generate a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element referencing the channel's streaming URL provided by the Channel Item metadata.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Detailed steps for &quot;Select and play recorded content from a Home Network Recording device&quot;:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Web page formats an action request to determine root container(s) for Recorded Content metadata on the selected Home Network device.
              <br />Notes:
              <ul>
                <li>Recorded Content Items are similar to stored Content Items. However, Recorded Content Items may contain metadata containing the ID of the Recording Service request that resulted in the creation of this item.</li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>Web page display information about recorded content item.</li>
              <li>Web page offers end-user the ability to play recorded item.</li>
              <li>Web page offers end-user the ability to manipulate the Recording request which created the item.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Notes for &quot;Select and play Time-Shift recorded content from a Home Network Recording device&quot;:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time-shift recording is an important variant of Network Recording. For Time-Shift recording no explicit request is required to record content; instead, the recording device automatically records the currently tuned channel (or favorite channel) in a circular buffer. Recorded content may be organized as one of more blocks of continuous content or as a list of separate captured programs.</li>
              <li>Time-shift recording generates temporary Content Items (bundles of content metadata). These content items are typically pointed to by the Channel Item that the content was captured from. For Time-shift Content Items some additional metadata properties are defined to indicate that the recording of an item may not be complete, and/or that a Content Item may represent a partial recording the original content.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Detailed steps for &quot;Select and play Time-Shift recorded content from a Home Network Recording device&quot;:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Web page access Channel Items (as described in prior use-case)</li>
              <li>Web page detects Channel Item lists to one or more Content Items as preserved content.</li>
              <li>Web page displays preserved Content Items which is available for the channel.</li>
              <li>Web page offers user ability to play preserved content by accessing URL in preserved Content Item.</li>
              <li>Web page offers user ability to convert preserved content to permanently recorded content by offering preserved Content Item(s) to the Network Recording service.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Existing Home Network interfaces do not (by scope/tradition) standardize user interface control. However, the combination of HTML markup and Javascript allow both access to Home Network devices functions and access to very capable user interface resources.</li>
              <li>Why were you not able to use only existing standards to accomplish this?
              <ul>
                <li>HTML User-Agents do not provided the abstractions necessary for Javascript to issue discover and issue commands to home network devices.</li>
                <li>Basic access methods to home network devices need to be standardized so that developers can implement pages to control Home Network devices using Javascript/HTML.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>What might you suggest could be standardized?
              <ul>
                <li>Provide generic access methods to enable a User-Agent to discover and command home network devices.</li>
                <li>Provide a means for applications to control some of the parameters that may need to be exposed to support well-established home network protocols. A more detailed analysis is needed to identify such parameters and a way to specify them in a transport agnostic way</li>
                <li>Provide access and privacy controls for untrusted pages accessing home network devices.</li>
                <li>Allow pages to discover functional differences (optional functionality) that may be implemented in some but not all Home Network ecosystem devices.</li>

Furthermore such approach would need a way to uniquely identify services (potentially across different home networking protocols) and expose relevant information for the user to understand what is actually authorizing. Such a technique would be then specification what would decide to enable a level interface for communication between devices/applications, which is not explicitly aware of different services.</p>

<h2><span class="secno">7. </span>Categorization of Requirements and Next Steps</h2>

      <p>One of the deliverable of the Home Network Task Force, according to its charter, is a set of recommendation to <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Director for recommendation track work fulfilling some (or all) of the identified requirements.</p>

      <p>This section summarizes the consensus of the TF about the desirable next steps and also to try to give an indication of relative priorities of the identified requirements.</p>
      
      <div id="requirements-categorization" class="section">
        <h3><span class="secno">7.1 </span>Requirements Categorization</h3>

        <p>The HNTF has made an attempt to categorize requirements based on the priority of addressing them to enable some of the use cases that are already available via other technologies or that are felt particularly important to have an enhanced user experience. Go without saying that all identified requirements are considered important by the Task Force; so the criteria followed is more the degree to which each requirements enables use cases that cannot be covered today rather than a value judgment of the importance of one requirement versus another (which differs by individual). By this &quot;enablement&quot; criterion, a feature that enables more use cases is higher priority than a feature that enables a limited subset of use cases.</p>

        <p>The following requirements underpin most (if not all) of the use cases (see <a href="#use-cases" class="sectionRef">section 5. Use Cases</a>) listed in this document, so they are considered the starting point for a technical work:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#service-discovery" class="sectionRef">section 4.2.1 Service Discovery</a></li>
          <li><a href="#content-discovery" class="sectionRef">section 4.2.3 Content Discovery</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These alone are insufficient to fulfill most of the use cases and user scenarios identified. The use cases that seem most straightforward to address next and which also show the most immediate utility are those that support the ability to control and query media playback:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#compatibility-with-widely-deployed-standards" class="sectionRef">section 4.1.1 Compatibility with widely deployed standards</a></li>
          <li><a href="#control-of-content-players" class="sectionRef">section 4.3.1 Control of Content Players</a></li>
          <li><a href="#playback-of-content" class="sectionRef">section 4.3.3 Playback of Content</a></li>

          <li><a href="#service-communication" class="sectionRef">section 4.3.8 Service Communication</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The requirements listed above focus on enabling applications to utilize existing home network services. The remaining requirements all enable use cases and scenarios that are of great interest and could be considered a &quot;next step&quot; of making it possible for applications to advertise and/or offer services. These requirements would allow leveraging web technologies and creating new types of application which mashes up Web and home networked devices.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#services-advertisement" class="sectionRef">section 4.2.5 Services Advertisement</a></li>

        </ul>

        <p>While security requirements are of really high priority in general, some of the requirement listed in this document may or may not be covered by <a href="#dfn-conforming-specifications" class="internalDFN">conforming specifications</a> depending on the particular technical solution that will be designed to cover the requirements listed above. That is why the following requirements to no fall into the High/Low priority scheme:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#application-trust-level" class="sectionRef">section 4.5.1 Application Trust Level</a></li>

        </ul>

        <p>Media Identification is a prerequisite for applications to be able to properly relate items of media content to a wider web of data/content. On the other end this requirement is orthogonal to the other discussed in this document and could be probably discussed in parallel with the work on the other requirements. That is why the following requirement is also not categorized:</p>

      <div id="identified-gaps" class="section">
        <h3><span class="secno">7.2 </span>Identified Gaps</h3>
        <p>A close analysis and discussion of the use-cases and requirements described in this document, lead the group to conclude that the <strong>major gap</strong> in the Open Web platform is the <strong>lack of means for an application to discover services and applications available on the home network</strong>. Filling such a gap will probably allow the coverage of most (if not all) requirements listed in this document (see <a href="#requirements" class="sectionRef">section 4. Requirements</a>).</p>

        <p>Some concerns were raised if the discovery alone is enough to address advertisements requirements especially for support of existing protocols such as UPnP. In fact, advertisements itself could be implemented as a service so that applications can discover it and then register to be advertised on the network. Such a service may be provided by the UA itself (i.e. the functionality is provided by the UA but exposed as a service) or by an external device. It is not clear though (lacking implementations of this) if this approach will be enough flexible and efficient.</p>

        <p>Furthermore to have an interoperable solution, a common advertising service would have to be standardized or JavaScript binding to already in use advertising services/protocols would have to be provided.</p>

        <p>The discussion will have to be deferred to the point in time when a User Agent supporting discovery is available.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="next-steps" class="section">
        <h3><span class="secno">7.3 </span>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>The HNTF believes that all the identified use cases and requirements are important to achieve a better convergence between the Web and TV. The TF also believes that all of them have an impact on the current web platform architecture so a recommendation track work would be needed to make sure that the identified requirements are covered in an open and interoperable way.</p>
        
        <p>The HNTF believes that many of the requirements identified here may match the deliverables in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/07/DeviceAPICharter">Device APIs Working Group Charter</a>. Therefore it is proposed to provide this requirement document as an input for further work to the <strong>Device APIs (DAP) Working Group</strong>. However, if after a more detailed analysis, requirements detailed in this document are found to be out-of-scope for the DAP WG, then the HNTF recommends that additional <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Working Groups be chartered to address the remaining requirements.</p>

        <p>Opera proposed a low-level API to address some of the use cases outlined in this document and discussed by the Home Network Task Force of the Web and TV IG. This section contains an outline of the proposal as presented to the DAP WG.</p>
    
        <div id="problem" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.2.1 </span>Problem</h4>
          <p>A number of devices connected within a local network today advertise service API endpoints to the network, the primary purpose of which is to allow other devices within the same local network to connect, control and interact with those services through the provided interfaces.</p>
          <p>It is possible today to build native applications that can both discover and communicate with such local-networked services. There is currently no standard or, indeed, any particularly easy way to discover or interact with local devices and services from a web application without significant technical hackery on the part of the user (see 'current practice' below).</p>
          <p>We need a way for a user agent, acting as a broker between a user and a web application to discover services via common discovery protocols (i.e. SSDP and DNS-SD) within the local network, allow web applications to request a particular service type (or class of service) that it wishes to interact with and then for a user to authorize that connectivity based on services found in their local network matching the requested service type. The solution should then enable communication to occur between the authorized web application and the local-networked service, bypassing or overriding the same-origin policy rule if necessary to allow for safe and secure cross-domain communication.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="current-practice" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.2.2 </span>Current Practice</h4>
          <p>Assuming the user is able to obtain a local-networked service's host and port information, which in itself is a hard task for both technical and non-technical users alike, the user must then provide that host and port information to the web application by entering such information in e.g. a web form and submitting said form. Having got this far the web application, despite having all the information required to communicate with a local-networked device/service, is then likely to encounter another issue, namely the same-origin policy rule which prevents a web application from communicating with a networked device that does not share the same host and port origin combination as itself.</p>
          <p>As a solution to this, CORS has been developed to enable cross-origin messaging from web applications. Within the home network, if the target networked device happened to provide the HTTP header <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> then there is little problem with the browser now being able to communicate with the provided host and port.</p>
          <p>However, the majority of local-networked services do not implement CORS and because <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> is generally a bad idea to enable within a local network, it is not really the ideal future-facing solution within local networks to ensure access is granted only to web applications that a user has explicitly authorized access to.</p>
          <p>In the vast majority of use cases communication from a web application to a local-networked service is blocked or inherently insecure today due to one or more of the issues above being present in modern web browsers.</p>
          <p>The current practice therefore does not fulfill the requirements of the initial problem and so we began to consider alternative approaches.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="proposed-solution" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.2.3 </span>Proposed Solution</h4>
          <p>To counter the issues identified in the current practice above we developed a low-level API, produced incrementally over the course of the last few months, that allows a web application to request a particular service type (or class of service type) and for the user to then be able to authorize and connect a discovered matching service to the requesting web application. This enables a user-authorized web application to control, interact and synchronize content (and otherwise generally communicate) with home-networked services, negating the operational issues present in browsers today.</p>
          <p>The proposed solution is available, see Networked Service Discovery and Messaging [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-DISCO-PROP">DISCO-PROP</a></cite>].</p>
          <p>A note on CORS: this API is intended to work with or without CORS support enabled in local-networked services. That is to say, CORS in combination with e.g. HTTP authentication schemes, assuming such a model is deployed widely in the future, may provide a good user authorization model for this API (perhaps even to the point of negating the need for any specialized Service Discovery user interfaces at all). As it stands, the proposed solution is intended to work with existing services deployed within local networks without shoe-horning all communications in to a future-only CORS model.</p>
          <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This API proposal does not represent the consensus of any standards group and should not be referenced as anything other than an unofficial draft which is a work in progress.</p>

          <h4><span class="secno">8.2.4 </span>BBC</h4>
          <p>The BBC is non-profit, publicly funded broadcaster based in the UK that also engages in technical research. As part of its participation in the Home Network TF, the BBC has shared its own experimental API work that enables clients, including HTML user agents, to discover and communicate with television style devices within the home network.</p>
          <p>This API defines a RESTful web service to be implemented by a television, set-top-box, or similar device. The data model represents programmes and sources of programmes in a relatively abstract way. The API in turn defines a uniform way to discover, identify, acquire (e.g. record) and control playback of programme content. There is also provision for starting and communicating with web or native applications running on the television. Applications using this API avoid having to deal with issues of codec, container format or transport protocol compatibility.</p>
          <p>Documents providing background, an introductory overview and a draft specification of the API are available:</p>

          </ul>
          <p>The BBC has prototyped various remote control and second screen experiences that use this API. These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The presentation of time-synchronised slideshows</li>
            <li>Near-lip-synced alternative audio</li>

        <h3><span class="secno">8.4 </span>CEA-2014 Web-based Protocol and Framework for Remote User Interface - Overview</h3>

        <p>CEA-2014 [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-CEA-2014">CEA-2014</a></cite>] describes web based Remote UI applications for CE devices. CEA-2014 is referenced by multiple Standards Development Organizations to provide ecosystem specific Remote UI solutions.</p>
        <p>CEA-2014 leverages existing web technology standards including XHTML for screen layout and user interactions; and ECMAScript for interactive application support. In addition, CEA-2014 provides additional standardized interfaces addressing the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remote UI Application Listing</li>
          <li>Client Capabilities Matching</li>
          <li>Standardized Audio-Video Player</li>
          <li>Digital Rights Management Framework</li>
          <li>Content Download Management Framework</li>
          <li>UPnP / DLNA Home Network Framework</li>
          <li>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) integration with XHTML</li>
          <li>Server to Client Notification Framework</li>
          <li>Remote UI Save and Restore Framework</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="remote-ui-application-listing" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.1 </span>Remote UI Application Listing</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 defines a mechanism for a Remote UI server to list available applications. This mechanism is based on an XML schema (XML UI Listing) which provides application descriptive metadata. In addition, a CEA-2014 server may include metadata for multiple versions of the same Remote UI application with differing client capability requirements. A Remote UI client system may then choose a version of a Remote UI application which best matches its capabilities. See Client Capability Matching in the following section</p>
        </div>

        <div id="client-capabilities-matching" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.2 </span>Client Capabilities Matching</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 defines XML metadata describing the capabilities of a connecting Remote UI client system. These capabilities include Input Support (Remote Control, Keyboard, etc.), AV Player Capabilities, Client Display Capabilities (resolution, color space) and Digital Rights Management capabilities. When a Remote UI client connects to a server, it will first examine the capability requirements of the Remote UI applications offered and will connect to a version that best matches its capabilities. During connection, the Remote UI Client provides its capabilities to the server. The server may modify the web-page provided to better match the connecting client's capabilities or may reject the connection if it cannot tailor the page to support the client's capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="standardized-audio-video-player" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.3 </span>Standardized Audio-Video Player</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 defines a standardized Audio-Video Player object. The AV Player object provides methods for control of AV playback (Play, Stop, Pause, Seek and Loop). In addition the AV player provides a &quot;lock-out&quot; mechanism disables end-users from skipping &quot;required content&quot;. AV player callbacks are defined to notify web-pages of various playback related state-changes. The CEA specification defines a state-machine for the AV player so web-pages can rely on predictable AV player state transition behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="digital-rights-management-framework" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.4 </span>Digital Rights Management Framework</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 defines a framework to allow a Remote UI application (web-page) to communicate with DRM Agent(s) installed on a Remote UI client. This DRM framework allows generic messaging between the web-page and DRM Agents installed on the Remote UI client.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> CEA-2014 does not define the specifics of any particular DRM system beyond listing of available Digital Rights systems in Remote UI client capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="content-download-management-framework" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.5 </span>Content Download Management Framework</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 defines a framework for Remote UI applications to initiate the download of content. Once the download process is started the Remote UI client can switch to other Remote UI applications. In addition to providing status of download operations, CEA-2014 defines a Content Access Descriptor XML schema to describe content to be downloaded. Since Content Access Descriptors are XML documents they may be associated with URLs and embedded into Remote UI applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="upnp---dlna-home-network-framework" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.6 </span>UPnP / DLNA Home Network Framework</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 defines a UPnP / DLNA binding so that web-pages can discover and control home network devices. The binding allows Remote UI applications discover, manage events and command UPnP and DLNA devices. In conjunction with the UPnP / DLNA Home Network Framework the Standardized AV Player is required to comply with DLNA media transport requirements. The combination makes CEA-2014 Remote UI clients suitable to support both UPnP and DLNA applications.</p>
          <p>The ability for Remote UI applications (originating from outside the home) to access home network devices presents significant security and privacy concerns. CEA-2014 requires implementation of a variety of security mechanisms to protect end-users Remote UI applications performing unauthorized access to Home Network devices.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="svg--scalable-vector-graphics--integration-with-xhtml" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.7 </span>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) integration with XHTML</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 supports the embedding of SVG markup within XHTML pages and vice versa. CEA-2014 addresses some issues with regard to differing DOM models and event handling between SVG and XHTML resulting from the combination of SVG and XHTML content on the same web-page.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="server-to-client-notification-framework" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.8 </span>Server to Client Notification Framework</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 provides the capability for servers to request Remote UI clients display web-pages. An &quot;event&quot; mechanism is defined so that Remote UI clients and servers can classify these Notification messages. In addition CEA-2014 clients may recover previously sent notifications that may have been missed while the Remote UI client was not present on the network.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="remote-ui-save-and-restore-framework" class="section">
          <h4><span class="secno">8.4.9 </span>Remote UI Save and Restore Framework</h4>
          <p>CEA-2014 provides a framework for a Remote UI application to save its state and POST it to a Remote UI server. The saved information consists of a reference to the original Remote UI application URL and metadata describing the saved state of the application. The save state may be restored by a different device effectively allowing the application to be moved to a different Remote UI client. The save-restore process may be triggered by the Remote UI application itself or by a request initiated external to the Remote UI client.</p>
