<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This document describes fundamental requirements for the
specifications under development in the W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2002/mmi/">Multimodal Interaction
Activity</a>. These requirements were derived from use case studies
as discussed in <a href="#Appendixa">Appendix A</a>. They have been
developed for use by the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2002/mmi/Group/">Multimodal Interaction
Working Group</a> (<a

related external standard activities.</p>

<p>The requirements cover general issues, inputs, outputs,
architecture, integration, synchronization points, runtimes and
deployments, but this document does not address application or
deployment conformance rules.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Multimodal interactions extend the Web user interface to allow
multiple modes of interaction, offering users the choice of using
their voice, or an input device such as a key pad, keyboard, mouse
or stylus. For output, users will be able to listen to spoken
prompts and audio, and to view information on graphical displays.
This capability for the user to specify the mode or device for a
particular interaction in a particular situation is expected to
significantly improve the user interface, its accessibility and
reliability, especially for mobile applications. The W3C Multimodal
Interaction Working Group (WG) is developing markup specifications
for authoring applications synchronized across multiple modalities
or devices with a wide range of capabilities.</p>

<p>This document is an internal working draft prepared as part of
the discussions on multimodal interaction requirements for
multimodal interaction specifications.</p>

<p>The work on the present requirement document started from the
<em>multimodal requirements for voice markup languages public
working draft (version 1.0)</em> published by the W3C Voice
activity <a href="#MMReqVoice">[MM Req Voice]</a>. The outline of
the document remains very similar.</p>

<p>The present requirements scope the nature of the work and
specifications that will be developed by the W3C Multimodal
Interaction Working Group (as specified by the charter <a
href="#MMIcharter">[MMI Charter]</a>). These intended works may be
referred to below as "specification(s)".</p>

<p>The requirements in this document do not express conformance
rules on application, platform runtime implementation or
deployment.</p>

<p>In this document, the following conventions have been followed
when phrasing the requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>"MUST specify": The specifications will address and satisfy the
requirement or supporting the features, starting from the first
version.</li>

<li>"SHOULD specify": The specifications will aim at addressing and
satisfying the requirement or supporting the features during the
lifetime of the working group. Early specifications will take this
into account to allow easy and interoperable updates.</li>

<li>"NICE to specify": The specifications will be designed with the
requirement or feature taken into account. If a technical solution
is available, the specifications will try to satisfy the
requirement or support the feature, provided that it does not
excessively delay the work plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not required that a particular specification produced by
the W3C MMI working group addresses <em>all</em> the requirements
in this document. It is possible that the requirements be addressed
by different specifications and that all the "MUST specify"
requirement are only satisfied by combining the different
specifications produced by the W3C Multimodal Interaction Working
Group. However, in such a case, it should be possible to clearly
indicate which specification will address what requirements.</p>

<h2 id="MMIframework">Multimodal interactions</h2>

<p>To lay the groundwork for the technical requirements, we first
discuss an intended frame of reference for a multimodal system,
introducing various concepts and terms that will be referred to in
the normative sections below. For the reader's convenience, we have
collected the concepts and terms introduced in this frame of
reference in the <a href="#Appendixb">glossary</a>.</p>

<p>We are interested in defining the requirements for the design of
<a href="#multimodalsystem">multimodal systems</a> -- systems that
support a user communicating with an application by using different
<a href="#modality">modalities</a> such as voice (in a <a
href="#humanlanguage">human language</a>), gesture, <a
href="#handwriting">handwriting</a>, typing, <a
href="#audiovisualspeech">audio-visual speech</a>, etc. The user
may be considered to be operating in a <a
href="#deliverycontext">delivery context</a>: a term used to
specify the set of attributes that characterizes the capabilities
of the access mechanism in terms of <a href="#deviceprofile">device
profile</a>, <a href="#userprofile">user profile</a> (e.g.
identify, preferences and usage patterns) and <a
href="#situation">situation</a>. The user interacts with the
application in the context of a <a href="#session">session</a>,
using one or more modalities (which may be realized through one or
more devices). Within a session, the user may <a
href="#suspendresume">suspend and resume</a> interaction with the
application within the same modality or <a
href="#modalityswitch">switch</a> modalities. A session is
associated with a <a href="#sessioncontext">context</a>, which
records the interactions with the user.</p>

<p>In multimodal systems, an <a href="#event">event</a> is a
representation of some asynchronous occurrence of interest to the
multimodal system. Examples include mouse clicks, hanging up the
phone, speech recognition results or errors. Events may be
associated with information about the user interaction e.g. the
location the mouse was clicked. A typical event source is a user,
such events are called <a href="#input">input events</a>. An <a
href="#externalevent">external input event</a> is one not generated
by a user, e.g. a <a href="#GPS">GPS</a> signal. The multimodal
system may also produce <a href="#externalevent">external output
events</a> for external systems (e.g. a logging system). In order
to preserve temporal ordering, events may be <a
href="#timestamp">time stamped</a>. Typically, events are
formalized as generated by <a href="#eventsource">event
sources</a>, and associated with <a href="#eventhandler">event
handlers</a>, which <a href="#subscribe">subscribe</a> to the
event, and are <a href="#notify">notified</a> of its occurrence.
This is exemplified by the <a href="#XMLEvent">XML Event</a>
model.</p>

<p>The user typically provides input in one or more modalities, and
receives output in one or more modalities.&nbsp; Input may be
classified as <a href="#sequentialinput">sequential</a>, <a
href="#simultaneousinput">simultaneous</a> or <a
href="#compositeinput">composite</a>. Sequential input is input
received on a single modality, though that modality can change over
time. Simultaneous input is input received on multiple modalities,
and treated separately by downstream processes (such as
interpretation). Composite input is input received on multiple
modalities at the same time and treated as a single, integrated
"composite" input by downstream processes. Inputs are combined
using the <a href="#coordinationcapability">coordination
capability</a> of the multimodal system, typically driven by <a
href="#inputconstraints">input constraints</a> or decided by the <a
href="#dialogmanager">interaction manager</a>.</p>

<p>Input is typically subject to <a href="#inputprocessing">input
processing</a>. For instance, speech input may be input to a <a
href="#speechrecognitionengine">speech recognition engine</a>
(including, for instance, <a href="#semanticinterp">semantic
interpretation</a> in order to extract meaningful information (e.g.
<a href="#semanticrep">semantic representation</a>) for downstream
processing. Note that simultaneous and composite input may be <a
href="#conflictinginput">conflicting</a>, in that the
interpretations of the input may not be consistent (e.g. the user
says "yes" but clicks on "no").</p>

<p><a>Two fundamentally different uses of multimodality may be
identified:</a> <a href="#supplementarymm">supplementary
multimodality</a>, and <a href="#complementarymm">complementary
multimodality</a>. An application makes supplementary use of
multimodality if it allows to&nbsp; carry every interaction (input
or output) through to completion in each modality as if it was the
only available modality. Such an application enables the user to
select at each time the modality that is best suited to the nature
of the interaction and the user's situation. Conversely, an
application makes complementary use of multimodality if
interactions in one modality are used to complement interactions in
another. (For instance, the application may visually display
several options in a form and aurally prompt the user "Choose the
city to fly to".) Complementary use may help a particular class of
users (e.g. those with dyslexia). Note that in an application
supporting complementary use of different modalities each
interaction may not be acessible separately in each modality.
Therefore it may not be possible for the user to determine which
modality to use. Instead, the document author may prescribe the
modality (or modalities) to be used in a particular
interaction.</p>

<p>The <a href="#synchronizationbehavior">synchronization
behavior</a> of an application describes the way in which any input
in one modality is reflected in the output in another modality, as
well as the way input is combined across modalities (<a
href="#coordinationcapability">coordination capability</a>). The <a
href="#synchronizationlevel">synchronization granularity</a>
specifies the level at which the application coordinates
interactions. The application is said to exhibit <em>event-level
synchronization</em> if user inputs in one modality are captured at
the level of the individual <a href="#DOM">DOM</a> events and
immediately reflected in the other modality. The application
exhibits <em>field-level synchronization</em> if inputs in one
modality are reflected in the other after the user changes focus
(e.g. moves from input field to input field) or completes the
interaction (e.g. completes a select in a menu). The application
exhibits <em>form-level synchronization</em> if inputs in one
modality are reflected in the other only after a particular point
in the presentation is reached (e.g. after a certain number of
fields have been completed in the form).</p>

<p>The output generatedstatus by a multimodal system can take
various forms, e.g. audio (including spoken prompts and playback,
e.g. using <a href="#NLG">natural language generation</a>, <a
href="#TTS">text-to-speech (TTS)</a> which <a
href="#synthesis">synthesizes</a> audio), visual (e.g. XHMTL or SVG
markup rendered on displays), <a
href="#lipsynch">lipsynch</a>(multimedia output in which there is a
visual rendition of a face whose lip movements are synchronized
with the audio), etc. Of relevance here is the W3C Recommendation
<a href="#SMIL">SMIL 2.0</a> which enables simple authoring of
interactive audiovisual applications and supports <a
href="#mediasynch">media synchronization</a>.</p>

<p>Interaction (input, output) between the user and the application
may often be conceptualized as a series of dialogs, manged by an <a
href="#dialogmanager">interaction manager</a>. A dialog is an
interaction between the user and the application which involves
<em>turn taking</em>. In each turn, the interaction manager manager
(working on behalf of the application) collects input from the
user, processes it (using the session context and possibly external
knowledge sources) to determine , computes a response and updates
the presentation for the user. An interaction manager generates or
updates the presentation by processing user inputs, session context
and possibly other external knowledge sources to determine the
intent of the user. An interaction manager relies on strategies to
determine focus and intent as well as to disambiguate, correct and
confirm sub-dialogs. We typically distinguish <a
href="#directeddialog">directed dialogs</a> (e.g. user-driven or
application-driven) and <a href="#mixedinitiative">mixed
initiative</a> or free flow dialogs.</p>

<p>The interaction manager may use (1) inputs from the user, (2)
the session context, (3) external knowledge sources, and (4)
disambiguation, correction, and configuration sub-dialogs to
determine the user's focus and intent. Based on the user's focus
and intent, the interaction manager also (1) maintains the context
and state of the application, (2) manages the composition of inputs
and synchronization across modalities, (3) interfaces with business
logic, and (4) produces output for presentation to the user. In
some architectures, the interaction manager may have <a
href="#distributedcomponents">distributed components</a>, utilizing
an event based mechanism for coordination.</p>

<p>Finally, in this document, we use the term <a
href="#executionmodel">configuration or execution model</a> to
refer to the runtime structure of the various system components and
their interconnection, in a particular manifestation of a
multimodal system.</p>

<h2 id="generalrequirements">1. General Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="Scalabilityacrosswiderangeofdevicescapabilities">1.1
Scalability across wide range of device capabilities</h3>

<p>It is the intent of the WG to define specifications that apply
to a variety of multimodal capabilities and deployment
conditions.</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-G1"
name="MMI-G1">(MMI-G1)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
MUST support authoring multimodal applications for a wide range of
multimodal capabilities (MUST specify).</p>

<p>The specifications should support different combinations of
input and output modalities, <a
href="#synchronizationlevel">synchronization granularity</a>, <a
href="#configuration">configurations</a> and <a
href="#device">devices</a>. Some aspects of this requirement are
elaborated in detail below. For instance, the range of <a
href="#synchronizationlevel">synchronization granularity</a> is
addressed by requirement <a href="#MMI-A6">MMI-A6</a>.</p>

<p>It is advantageous that the specifications allow the application
developer to author a single version of the application, instead of
multiple versions targeted at combinations of multimodal
capabilities.</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-G2"
name="MMI-G2">(MMI-G2)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
SHOULD support authoring multimodal applications once for
deployment on difference devices with different multimodal
capabilities (NICE to specify).</p>

<p>The multimodal capabilities may differ based on available
modalities, presentation and interaction capability for each
modality (modality-specific delivery context), synchronization
granularity, available devices and their configurations
etc...&nbsp; They are to be captured in the delivery context
associated to the multimodal system.</p>

<h3 id="Supplementaryandcomplementaryuseofdifferentmodalities">1.2
Supplementary and complementary use of different modalities</h3>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-G3"
name="MMI-G3">(MMI-G3)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
MUST support <a href="#supplementarymm">supplementary</a> use of
modalities (MUST specify).</p>

<p>Supplementary use of modalities in multimodal applications
significantly improves accessibility of the applications. The user
may select the modality best used to the nature of the interaction
and the context of use.</p>

<p>When supported by the runtime or prescribed by the author, it
may be possible for the user to combine modalities as discussed for
example in requirement <a href="#MMI-I7">MMI-I7</a> about composite
input.</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-G4"
name="MMI-G4">(MMI-G4)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
MUST support <a href="#complementarymm">complementary</a> use of
modalities (MUST specify).</p>

<p>Authors of multimodal applications that rely on complementary
multimodality should pay special attention to the accessibility of
the application, for example by ensuring accessibility in each
modality or by providing supplementary alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="Seamlesssynchronizationofmodalities">1.3 Seamless
synchronization of modalities</h3>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-G5" name="MMI-G5">(MMI-G5)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications will be designed such that an author can write
applications where the <a
href="#synchronizationbehavior">synchronization</a> of the various
modalities is seamless from the user's point of view (MUST
specify).</span></p>

<p>To elaborate, an interaction event or an external event in one
modality results in a change in another; based on the <a
href="#synchronizationlevel">synchronization granularity</a>
supported by the application. See <a
href="#Synchronizationgranularities">section 4.5</a> for a
discussion of synchronization granularities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Seamlessness can
encompass multiple aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Limited latency in the
synchronization behavior with respect to what is expected by the
user for the particular application and multimodal
capabilities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Predictable,
non-confusing multimodal behavior</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Expanding on the considerations made in <a
href="#Scalabilityacrosswiderangeofdevicescapabilities">section
1.1</a>, it is important to support authoring for any granularity
of synchronization covered in <a href="#MMI-A6">(MMI-A6)</a>:</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-G6" name="MMI-G6">(MMI-G6)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST support authoring seamless synchronization of
various modalities for any any</span> <a
href="#synchronizationlevel">synchronization granularity</a> <span
class="requirement">and <a
href="#coordinationcapability">coordination capabilities</a> (MUST
specify).</span></p>

<p>Coordination is defined as the capability to combine multimodal
inputs into composite inputs based on an interpretation algorithm
that decides what makes sense to combine based on the context.
Composite inputs are further discussed in <a

different from synchronization granularity described in <a

<p>The following requirement is proposed in order to address the
combinatorial explosion of synchronization granularities that the

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

other levels are available.</p>

<h3 id="Multilingualsupport">1.4 Multilingual support</h3>

<p>Multimodal applications are not different from any other web
applications. It is important that the specifications be not
limited to specific languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

<p>For example, it should be possible to encapsulate

<h3 id="Easytoimplement">1.5 Easy to implement</h3>

<p>It is important that multimodal applications remain easy to
author and deploy in order to allow wide adoption by the web
community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

<p>This is a generic requirement that requires designers to
consider from the outset issues of: ease-of-authoring by
application developers; ease-of-implementation by platform
developers and ease-of-use by the user. Thus it affects authoring,
platform implementation and deployment.</p>

<p>The following requirement qualifies this further to guarantee
that the specifications will be widely deployable with existing
technologies (e.g. standards, network and client capabilities
etc...)</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

<p>For W3C specifications, wide availability is understood as

<p>Related considerations are made in<a

<h3 id="accessibility">1.6 Accessibility</h3>

<p>Multimodal applications will provide mechanisms to develop and
deploy accessible applications as discussed in <a

1.2</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, it is important that, as for all other web

<p>This is especially important for applications that make

<h3 id="Securityandprivacy">1.7 Security and privacy</h3>

<p>Early deployments of multimodal applications show that security
and privacy issues can be very critical for multimodal deployments.
While addressing these issues is not directly within the scope of
the W3C Multimodal Interaction Working Group, it is important that
these issues be considered.</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-G13"

</ul>

<p>Other considerations and issues may exist and should be
compiled.</p>

<h3 id="Deliveryandcontext">1.8 Delivery and context</h3>

<p>Notions of profile and <a href="#deliverycontext">delivery
context</a> have been widely introduced to characterize the the
capabilities of devices and preferences of users.</p>

<p>From a multimodal point of view, different types of profiles are
relevant:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#userprofile">User profile</a> that may include user
credentials and user preferences and usage patterns that captures
the information manually or automatically the way that a user
interacts or likes to interact with a multimodal application</li>

<li><a href="#deviceprofile">Device profiles</a> that captures the
characteristics the capability of a particular devices used to
access an application.</li>
</ul>

<p>These profiles are combined into the notion of <a
href="#deliverycontext">delivery context</a> introduced by the W3C
device independent activity <a href="#DIactivity">[DI Activity]</a>
. The delivery context captures the set of attributes that
characterize the capabilities of the access mechanism (device or
devices) (device profile), the dynamic preferences of the user (as
they relates to interaction through this device) and <a
href="#configuration">configurations</a>. Delivery context may
dynamically change as the application progresses, as the user
situation changes (situationalization) or as the number and
configurations of the devices change.</p>

<p>CC/PP is an example of formalism to describe and exchange the
delivery context <a href="#CCPP">[CC/PP]</a>.</p>

<p>Users of multimodal interactions will expect to be able to rely
on these profiles to optimize the way that multimodal applications
are presented to them.</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-G14" name="MMI-G14">(MMI-G14)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST enable optimization and adaptation of
multimodal applications based on <a
href="#deliverycontext">delivery context</a> or dynamic changes of
delivery context (MUST specify).</span></p>

<p>Dynamic changes of delivery context encompass situations where
available devices, modalities and configurations; or usage
preferences dynamically. These changes can be involuntary or
initiated by the user, the application developer or the service
providers.</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

specifications MUST enable authors to specify how <a
href="#deliverycontext">delivery context</a> and changes of

application (MUST specify).</span></p>

<p>The description of such impacts on a multimodal application
could be specified by the author but modified by the user, platform
vendor or service provider. In particular, the author can describe
how the application can be be affected or adapted to the delivery
context but the user and service providers should be able to modify
the delivery context. <em>Other use cases should also be
considered.</em></p>

<h3 id="Navigationspecification">1.9 Navigation specification</h3>

<p>It is expected that the author of multimodal application should
always be able to specify the expected flow of navigation (i.e.
sequence of interaction) through the application or the algorithm
to determine such a flow (e.g. in mixed initiative cases). This
leads to the following requirement:</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-G16" name="MMI-G16">(MMI-G16)</a>:</strong> The multimodal

algorithms to determine the navigation flow (MUST
specify).</span></p>

<h2 id="Inputmodalityrequirements">2. Input Modality
Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="Inputprocessing">2.1 Input processing</h3>

<p>Numerous modalities or input types require some form of
processing before the nature of the input is identified. For
instance, speech input requires speech detection and speech
recognition which requires specific data files (e.g. grammars,
language models etc). Similarly handwritten input requires
recognition.</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-I1"
name="MMI-I1">(MMI-I1)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
MUST provide a mechanism to specify and attach modality related
information when authoring a multimodal application.&nbsp; (MUST

<p>This implies that authors should be able to include
modality-related information, such as the media types, processing
requirements or fallback mechanisms that a user agent will need for
the particular modality. Mechanisms should be available to make
this available to the user agent.</p>

<p>For example, audio input may be recognized (speech recognizer),
recorded or processed by speaker recognizers, natural language
processing, using specific data files (e.g. grammar, language
model), etc. The author must be able to completely define such
processing steps.</p>

<p>It should be remarked, however, that the actual granularity of

<p>This requirement enables the application developer to specify
how the performance of the application can degrade gracefully with
changes in the input mechanism. For instance, it should be possible
to access an application designed for event-level or field-level
synchronization between voice (on the server side) and GUI (on the
terminal) on a network that permits only session-level
synchronization (that is, permits only <a

<li>Field-level input synchronization: Inputs in one modality are
reflected in the other after the user finishes performing a
particular interaction with a field. This can be detected because
the user in general changes / sets a value in the data model. For
example, this results from a changes focus (e.g. move from input
field to input field) or completes the interaction (e.g. complete a
select in a menu).</li>

<li>Page-level: Inputs in one modality are reflected in the other
only after submission of the page.</li>

<p>Nothing imposes that input and output, even in a same modality,

<h2 id="Runtimesanddeployments">5. Runtimes and deployments</h2>

<h3 id="Configurations">5.1 Configurations</h3>

<p>It is expected that users will interact with multimodal
applications through different deployment configurations (i.e.
architectures): the different modules responsible for media
rendering, input capture, processing, synchronization,
interpretation etc, may be partitioned or combined on a single
device or distributed across several devices or servers. As
previously discussed, these configurations may dynamically
change.</p>

<p>The specifications of such configuration is beyond the scope of
the W3C Multimodal Interaction Working Group. However:</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-C1"
name="MMI-C1">(MMI-C1)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
MUST support the deployment of multimodal applications authored
according the W3C MMI specifications, with all the relevant
deployment configurations where functions are partitioned or
combined on a single engine or distributed across several devices
or servers (MUST specify).</p>

<p>The possibility to interact with multiple devices leads
naturally to multi-user access to applications.</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-C2"
name="MMI-C2">(MMI-C2)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
SHOULD support multi-user deployments (NICE to specify).</p>

<h3 id="Mobiledeployments">5.2 Mobile deployments</h3>

<p>Multimodal interactions are especially important for mobile
deployments. Therefore, the W3C multimodal working group will pay
attention to the constraints associated to mobile deployments and
especially cell phones.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-R1"
name="MMI-R1">(MMI-R1)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
MUST be compatible with deployments based on user agents /
renderers that run on mobile platforms (MUST specify).</p>

<p>Mobile platforms, like smart phones, are typically constrained
in terms of processing power and memory available. It is expected
that the multimodal specifications will take such constraints into
account and be designed so that multimodal deployments are possible
on smart phones.</p>

<p>In addition, it is important to pay attention to the challenges
introduced by mobile networks like: limited bandwidth, delays
etc...:</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-R2"
name="MMI-R2">(MMI-R2)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications
MUST support deployments over mobile networks, considering the
bandwidth limitations and delays that they may introduce (MUST
specify).</p>

<p>This may enable deployment techniques or specification from
other standard activity to provision the necessary quality of
service.</p>

<h3 id="EMMA">5.3 EMMA</h3>

<p>The following requirements apply to the objectives for the
specification work on EMMA as defined in the <a
href="#Appendixb">glossary</a>. EMMA is intended to support the
necessary exchanges of information between the multimodal modules
mentioned in <a href="#Configurations">section 5.1</a>.</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-E1"
name="MMI-E1">(MMI-E1)</a>:</strong> The multimodal specifications

events and results of input or output processing (MUST specify)</p>

<p class="requirement"><strong><a id="MMI-E2"

interpretation and combinations of input event and results of input
or output processing (MUST specify).</p>

their handler (MUST specify).</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

id="MMI-S5" name="MMI-S5">(MMI-S5)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST support the exchange of EMMA fragments as part
of the synchronization events content (MUST specify).</span></p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-S6" name="MMI-S6">(MMI-S6)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST support the specification of event handlers for
externally generated events (MUST specify).</span></p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-S7" name="MMI-S7">(MMI-S7)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST support the specification of event handlers for
externally generated events that result from the interaction of the
user (MUST specify).</span></p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-S8" name="MMI-S8">(MMI-S8)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST support handlers that manipulate or update the
presentation associated to a particular modality (MUST
specify).</span></p>

<p>In distributed configurations, it is important that
synchronization exchanges take place with minimum delays. In
practical deployments this implies that the highest available
quality of services should be allocated to such exchanges.</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-S9" name="MMI-S9">(MMI-S9)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST enable the identification of multimodal
synchronization exchanges. (MUST specify)</span></p>

<p>This would enable the underlying network to allocate the highest
quality of services associated to synchronization exchanges, if it
is aware of such needs. This network behavior is beyond the scope
of the multimodal specifications.</p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a
id="MMI-S10" name="MMI-S10">(MMI-S10)</a>:</strong> The multimodal
specifications MUST support confirmation of event handling (MUST
specify).</span></p>

specifications MUST support event generation or event handling
pending confirmation of a particular event handling (MUST
specify).</span></p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

specifications MUST be compatible with existing standards including
<a href="#DOM">DOM</a> events and <a href="#DOM">DOM</a>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

multimodal specifications SHOULD be compatible with existing
standards including <a href="#XMLEvent">XML events</a>
specifications (SHOULD specify).</span></p>

<p class="requirement"><span class="requirement"><strong><a

specification MUST allow lightweight multimodal synchronization
exchanges compatible with wireless network and mobile terminals

<h3 id="Appendixa">Appendix A: Use cases</h3>

<h4 id="Overviewoftheusecases">A.1 Overview of the use cases</h4>

<p>Analysis of use cases provides insight into the requirements for
applications likely to require a multimodal infrastructure.</p>

<p>The use cases described below were selected for analysis in
order to highlight different requirements resulting from
application variations in areas such as device requirements, event
handling, network dependencies and methods of user interaction</p>

<p><strong>Use Case Device Classification</strong></p>

<h5 id="ThinClient">Thin Client</h5>

<p>A device with little processing power and capabilities that can
be used to capture user input (microphone, touch display, stylus,
etc) as well as non-user input such as GPS. The device may have a
very limited capability to interpret the input, for example a small
vocabulary speech recognition, or a character recognizer. The bulk
of the processing occurs on the server including natural language
processing and interaction management.</p>

<p>An example of such a device may be a mobile phone with DSR
capabilities and a visual browser (there could actually be thinner
clients than this).</p>

<h5 id="ThickClient">Thick Client</h5>

<p>A device with powerful processing capabilities, such that most
of the processing can occur locally. Such a device is capable of
input capture and interpretation. For example, the device can have
a medium vocabulary speech recognizer, a handwriting recognizer,
natural language processing and interaction management
capabilities. The data itself may still be stored on the
server.</p>

<p>An example of such a device may be a recent production PDA or an
in-car system.</p>

<h5 id="MediumClient">Medium Client</h5>

<p>A device capable of input capture and some degree of
interpretation. The processing is distributed in a client/server or
a multi-device architecture. For example, a medium client will have
the voice recognition capabilities to handle small vocabulary
command and control tasks but connects to a voice server for more
advanced dialog tasks.</p>

<h5 id="ReservationScenario">Scenario Details</h5>

<p>User wants to make a flight reservation with his mobile device
while he is on the way to work. The user initiates the service via
means of making a phone call to a multimodal service (telephone
metaphor) or by selecting an application (portal environment
metaphor). The details are not described here.</p>

<p>As the user moves between networks with very different
characteristics, the user is offered the flexibility to interact
using the preferred and most appropriate modes for the situation.
For example, while sitting in a train, the use of stylus and
handwriting can achieve higher accuracy than speech (due to
surrounding noise) and protect privacy. When the user is walking,
the input and output modalities that more appropriate would be
voice with some visual output. Finally, at the office the user can
use pen and voice in a synergistic way.</p>

<p>The dialog between the user and the application is driven by a
form-filling paradigm where the user provides input to fields such
as "Travel Origin:", "Travel Destination:", "Leaving on date",
"Returning on date". As the user selects each field in the
application to enter information, the corresponding input
constraints are activated to drive the recognition and
interpretation of the user input. The capability of providing
composite multimodal input is also examined, where input from
multiple modalities is combined for the interpretation of the
user's intent.</p>

<h5 id="DialingScenario">Scenario Details</h5>

<p>Janet presses a button on her multimodal phone and says one of
the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call Wendy</li>

<li>Call Wendy on her cell phone</li>

<li>Call Wendy at work</li>

<li>Call Wendy Smith at Acme Research</li>
</ul>

<p>The application initially looks for a match in Janet's personal
contact list and if no match is found then proceeds to look in
other directories. Directed dialog and tapered help are used to
narrow down the search, using aural and visual prompts. Janet is
able to respond by pressing buttons, or tapping with a stylus, or
by using her voice.</p>

<p>Once a selection has been made, rules defined by Wendy are used
to determine how the call should be handled. Janet may see a
picture of Wendy along with a personalized message (aural and
visual) that Wendy has left for her. Call handling may depend on
the time of day, the location and status of the both parties, and
the relationship between them. An "ex" might be told to never call
again, while Janet might be told that Wendy will be free in half an
hour after Wendy's meeting has finished. The call may be
automatically directed to Wendy's home, office or mobile phone, or
Janet may be invited to leave a message.</p>

<h4 id="appendixa2analysis">A.2 Event analysis</h4>

<p>The use-case analysis exercise helped to identify the types of
events a multimodal system would likely need to support.</p>

<p>Based on the use case analysis, the following events
classifications were defined:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asynchronous vs. Synchronous</li>

<li>Local vs. remote generation</li>

<li>Local vs. remote handling</li>

<li>Input interpretation Events</li>

<li>Externally generated events vs. Events generated as a result of
user action</li>

<li>Actions vs. Notifications</li>
</ul>

consolidated in the following table.</p>
