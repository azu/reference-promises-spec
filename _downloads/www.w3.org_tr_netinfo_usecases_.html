Network information includes, but is not limited to, the type of network connection currently in use by a device (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.). It can also include information such as the system notifying the application when the type of connection changes from one type to another (e.g., from cellular to Wi-Fi).

</p><p>To create this document, we examined a range of applications across popular platforms to see how they make use of network information - particularly as it affects users. It also looks at how these applications respond to changes to network types and conditions.

</p><p>By looking at these applications we've come up with a set of requirements. We hope that the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> community can address these requirements by creating a specification that affords similar functionality to the web platform.

</p><p>The document concludes with a discussion of why exposing certain values would not be helpful to the design of an Network Information API. It also discusses some alternative approaches to how the use cases could be addressed without requiring an API.

id="h2_methodology-and-limitations" role="heading" aria-level="1"><span class="secno">1. </span>Methodology and limitations</h2><p>We used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling">convenience sampling</a> to select the applications in this study. That is, we selected applications that we knew made use of network information. We also reached out to people on twitter to suggest which applications we should look at.

</p><p>As stated on Wikipedia: "[one] cannot scientifically make generalizations about the total population from this sample because it would not be representative enough."

</p><p>Regardless, we view the collected range of applications as exemplifying common use cases for network information. As such, we still created requirements from what we observed across applications and platforms.

</p><p>We encourage the community to contribute more, or contradictory, examples to the Web Mobile IG.  You can do this via  a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-webmob/netinfo-usecases">NetInfo repository on GitHub</a>.

</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it does not consider future trends in telecommunication technology. Advances in communication technology could impact the applicability of the requirements. A future version of this document may address this shortcoming (see <a href="https://github.com/w3c-webmob/netinfo-usecases/issues/40">issue #40</a>).

</p><ul>

<li>What motivates this application to access network information? (e.g., save the user money.)</li>

<li>What can this application do when it has network information? (e.g., give the user the choice to prevent large downloads.)</li>

<li>Where applicable, how does this application respond to the device switching from one kind of network connection to another? (e.g., stops downloads, warns the users that the connection has changed.)</li>
</ul></section></section><section id="recurring-themes"><!--OddPage--><h2 id="h2_recurring-themes" role="heading" aria-level="1"><span class="secno">2. </span>Recurring themes</h2><p>From the applications and OSs examined below, the recurring themes include:

</p><ul>

<li>Warning the user that doing something over cellular could cost them money.</li>

<li>Detecting when a connection switches from cellular to Wi-Fi, and vice versa.</li>

<li>Giving the user control as to whether large uploads/downloads should happen over cellular (mostly related to synchronizing media data like photos, videos, and audio files).</li>

<li>Preventing accidental data transfers over cellular, which could use up the user's data transfer quota and/or cost them money.</li>
</ul></section><section id="requirements"><!--OddPage--><h2 id="h2_requirements" role="heading" aria-level="1"><span class="secno">3. </span>Requirements</h2><p>In order to be able to replicate the functionality seen in native applications, the requirements for the web platform appear to be:

</p><ul>

<li><p>provide access to the connection type the system is using to receive data (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or airplane mode). This information needs to be available either immediately on page load or as close as possible to it.</p>
</li>

<li><p>provide a means for scripts to be notified if the connection type changes. This is to allow developers to make dynamic changes to the DOM and/or inform the user that the network connection type has changed (and that it could impact them in some way).</p>
</li>
</ul></section><section id="web-applications"><!--OddPage--><h2 id="h2_web-applications" role="heading" aria-level="1"><span class="secno">4. </span>Web applications</h2><p>The following are examples of web applications that use various means to detect if a user is on Wi-Fi or cellular.

</p><section id="bbc-news"><h3 id="h3_bbc-news" role="heading" aria-level="2"><span class="secno">4.1 </span>BBC News</h3><p>When the user tries to watch a video on a cellular connection, the <a href="http://bbc.com/news/">BBC News</a> website warns the user that it might cost them money.

</p><p><img src="images/web_bbc_cellular.png" alt="BBC News Website warns users of potential costs to watching videos online">

</p><p>The warning is not presented to users when they access the site over over Wi-Fi. According to Jim Lay of the BBC:

</p><blockquote>

<p>It's part of our GeoIP service to detect mobile gateways, which is then used - we show it on all devices tethered laptops as well as mobile ones, and the single shown on load message is okay for this - doesn't matter if the user is flip-flopping across a mobile and non-mobile connection during a session.

</p>


<p>It's possible that knowing during a page session that it's swapped between would be useful, as well as using it for the message we also use it for selecting appropriate quality media.

</p>

</blockquote><p>Note that network type detection is separate from their ability to do adaptive video streaming. That happens irrespective of connection type.

</p><p><img src="images/web_gmail.png" alt="GMail loading screen, with the option for the user to load up the basic HTML version">

</p></section><section id="carrier-billing---firefox-marketplace"><h3 id="h3_carrier-billing---firefox-marketplace" role="heading" aria-level="2"><span class="secno">4.3 </span>Carrier billing - Firefox Marketplace</h3><p>When paying for a product or service via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment#Direct_operator_billing">carrier billing</a>, the payment provider needs to confirm the user owns the phone account they intend to pay with before their account is charged. This is done by proving the user is in possession of the authorized SIM at the time of purchase.

</p><p>The authentication process varies depending on whether the user is connected via WiFi or the mobile network:

</p><ul>

<li>When connecting via the mobile network, many carriers are able to do Cellular-based Authentication. Such authentication is accomplished by querying the carrier's infrastructure from which SIM the HTTP request comes from. Once authenticated, the payment provider receives the authentication from the carrier's system (e.g: by injecting headers in the HTTP request). This process is done automatically and doesn't require customer interaction: users' don't need to type their phone number nor verify it, everything is handled by the network operator.</li>
</ul><p><img src="images/web_firefox_market_advise_of_charge.png" alt="User prompted to pay with no user interaction">

</p><ul>

<li>When Cellular-based Authentication is not available (e.g: user is connected via WiFi) authentication requires user interaction. Typically, the users are required to type their phone number, they receive an SMS in such phone number with a one-time PIN that the user needs to type back to complete the authentication. Firefox Marketplace does so as illustrated bellow:</li>
</ul><p>User is prompted to enter the phone number they want to pay with.

</p><p><img src="images/web_firefox_market_phone_number_form.png" alt="User prompted to enter phone number">

</p><p>User is sent a PIN via SMS and prompted and requested to enter the PIN to verify the phone number:

</p><p>User gets to the advice of charge screen to confirm the payment:

</p><p><img src="images/web_firefox_market_advise_of_charge.png" alt="User prompted to pay with no user interaction">

</p><p>In order to decide what authentication process to trigger, payment providers currently try to identify the type of connection on the server. This usually entails maintaining lists of IP ranges for each carrier they integrate and some extra redirections.

It's unclear how the application detects the bandwidth or what it deems a "slow connection". We can only speculate that it means latency or raw download speed from their servers. It also seems to do this erroneously as the Wi-Fi connection is at full-strength. So the alert doesn't help the user, as there is nothing they can do to rectify the situation.

</p><p><img src="images/ios_npr.png" alt="NPR slow download confirmation dialog">

<em> We did not find any valid use case.
</em> As it's so dynamic, it's hard to estimate.

</p><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/coremob/wiki/Features/Network_Information_API#Poor_man.27s_adaptive_streaming">Adaptive streaming according to network conditions</a> is not a use case that can be addressed by the Network Information API. Instead,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP">DASH</a> and/or the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/default/media-source/media-source.html">MediaSource Extensions API</a> are better suited to address adaptive streaming. Check this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UklDSMG9ffU">interesting video</a> about this topic.

</p><p>Use cases like an image viewer that can select a low or high definition image based on the current connection bandwidth are being addressed by the <a href="http://responsiveimages.org/">Responsive Images Community Group</a> - see in particular <a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org">the <code>picture</code> element</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grigorik-http-client-hints">Client Hints</a>. For performance reasons, the choice of which image to load should be left to the browser (instead of scripts). The browser can use  knowledge of the screen’s pixel density, or whatever other factors it deems relevant, to choose content responsibly.

</p><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/#outstanding-issues">Outstanding issues section</a> of the second version of Network Information API already mentions that <em>"<code>bandwidth</code> may be hard to implement and can be quite power-consuming to keep up-to-date"</em> as it may require regularly sending test payloads that can also add extra costs to the user (probably very significant when roaming). <em>"Its value might be unrelated to the actual connection quality that could be affected by the server"</em> and by other consumers of the same connection. It finally suggests a potential solution that could be <em>"to return non absolute values that couldn't be easily abused and would be more simple to produce for the user agent. For example, having a set of values like <code>very-slow</code>, <code>slow</code>, <code>fast</code> and <code>very-fast</code>. Another solution would be to have only values like <code>very-slow</code>, <code>slow</code> and the empty string"</em>. But this does not seem to be a good solution, even if the user agent is able to estimate the available bandwidth, the perception of network speed differs between consumers, what is considered fast enough for some network requests could be slow for others.

</p><p><a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/base/GeckoNetworkManager.java#72">Mozilla's Android implementation</a> maps static values based on the connection type, which is basically the same as exposing the network type, and it is quite inaccurate if the intention is to expose the network speed available. The theoretical maximum speed for the current connection type might be far from the real current speed. It does not only depend on the location, time of day, number of active peers but it is also controlled by the network provider. I can be connected via LTE but if I already consumed my monthly data plan, my connection will be really slow. That's why making assumptions about the network speed based on the connection type is not appropriate and should be discouraged. (Note that none of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-webmob/netinfo-usecases#use-cases-and-requirements">use cases</a> specifically mention this).

We didn't find any use case for "metered" that cannot be addressed by just exposing the connection type.

</p><p>It's often not possible for the browser to know this information without asking the network provider or the user. For the former, network operators would have to provide an API which enables user agents to query the user's data plan and its associated costs. This has obvious privacy implications. For the latter, it seems that developers can already ask the user if a specific connection type is metered or not and so keep a record of it if needed.

</p><p>So, we cannot see any additional value that exposing if a connection is <code>metered</code>. In addition, implementations like <a href="http://androidxref.com/4.3_r2.1/xref/frameworks/support/v4/java/android/support/v4/net/ConnectivityManagerCompat.java#37">Android</a> and <a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/base/GeckoNetworkManager.java#321">Firefox</a> already map the cellular connection type to a metered connection.

</p><p>It also avoids developers making assumptions about the speed of the network based on the connection type. Making such assumptions would likely have a negative impact on users. This is because developers might incorrectly downgrade content on assumptions that certain connection types means a particular network speed.

</p></section><section id="managing-downloads"><h3 id="h3_managing-downloads" role="heading" aria-level="2"><span class="secno">8.4 </span>Managing downloads</h3><p>When starting a large download, one ought to ask whether replicating the native use cases ought to be done by the app directly or through some mediation via the browser. For instance, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_manager">download manager</a> might be more effective for the "large download" use case: instead of developers having to manage downloads by inspecting the type of connection, a download manager could queue downloads until a certain connection type is available - plus provide the user with additional settings and options to pause/resume/cancel downloads, etc. A download manager could also take the form of an API that allows for file tranfers in the background. Scripts could then queue file transfers, and the user agent could then choose to transfer files when it sees fit: optimizing not only for network conditions, but also for battery and CPU usage (e.g. upload files when on Wi-Fi, plugged in, and with low CPU activity).

</p><p>Having said that, in-application downloads are very application specific (e.g., as in audio books for the Audible application which can be played as they download, or audio tracks for Spotify). So, while a the download manager would probably help with managing connection type, error recovery, and pausing/resuming/cancelling, the download process still needs to provide feedback (progress and errors) to the application irrespective of connection type.

</p><p>Additionally, given the reactive nature of content synchronization, having a global download manager may be difficult for user's to manage - as setting options for the download manager might override options in all applications. For example, a user may want to be able to download audio books on cellular ("cost/quota be damned!") but does not want to accidentally kick off a bunch of other synchronization tasks. In MacOS, for instance, this unwanted behavior can happen when the user tethers with a mobile device: as tethering simply acts like a Wi-Fi connection, a system-wide network availability event is sent out causing applications to start synchronizing. This can result in large amounts of data being transferred in the background unless the user intervenes by shutting down applications manually (e.g., email programs, Dropbox, etc.).
