    <h2><a shape="rect" id="abstract" name="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
    <p><cite>The QA Handbook</cite> (<acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym>) is a non-normative handbook about the process and operational aspects of certain quality assurance practices of W3C's Working Groups, with particular focus on testability and test topics. It is intended for Working Group chairs and team contacts. It aims to help them to avoid known pitfalls and benefit from experiences gathered from the W3C Working Groups themselves. It provides techniques, tools, and templates that should facilitate and accelerate their work. This document is one of the QA Framework (QAF) family of documents of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/QA/">Quality Assurance (<acronym>QA</acronym>) Activity</a>. QAF includes the other in-progress specification, <cite>Specification Guidelines</cite>, <cite>Test Development FAQ</cite>, plus a handful of test- and other QA-related notes, advanced topics, and Wiki page collections.</p>

    <h2>1. <a shape="rect" id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction &amp; roadmap</a></h2>
    <h3>1.1. <a shape="rect" name="Five-stories" id="Five-stories">Five simple stories</a></h3>
    <p>The following five use cases for <cite>The QA Handbook</cite> (<acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym>), told as stories, show when and how <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> could be helpful. They cover five different situations that might typically arise over the life of the Working Group.</p>
    <p><cite>The QA Handbook</cite> could be useful to Chairs and Staff Contacts at Charter time...</p>
    <div class="story">
        <p><span class="story-label">Story 1: Think about quality early</span><br />
        The Charter-drafting team of a new Working Group, led by Staff Contacts and co-Chairs, looks through <cite>The QA Handbook</cite>. Following the good practices in the <a shape="rect" href="#Early">early-commitment and planning</a> module, the team debates how much it can realistically commit to at this early stage. After deciding on some test materials deliverables, milestones, and specification synchronization that it considers to be safe commitments, the team uses the provided Charter Template to include these in the draft Charter.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Or it could help a Chair who is trying to jump-start a test suite project...</p>
    <div class="story">
        <p><span class="story-label">Story 2: Jump-starting a testing effort</span><br />
        An existing Working Group has just finished writing its Requirements and Use Cases documents, and has begun to draft its specification. At the same time, it is taking a first look at its test suite plans. As recommended in the <cite>The QA Handbook</cite>, the Chair jump starts the Test Suite project by <a shape="rect" href="#Logistics">appointing a point of contact and part-time Test Suite team</a>, whose first output is a quick QA Process Document (QAPD) using the provided QAPD template.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Or maybe the Chairs and Staff Contacts are pondering the transfer of a test suite from an external entity...</p>
    <div class="story">
        <p><span class="story-label">Story 3: Test-suite transfer</span><br />
        A Working Group has re-chartered to finish a Second Edition of its specification, and to develop the next functional version. The group did not develop a test suite during its first charter, but a collaboration of outside organizations and an industry consortium has developed one. The Chair and Staff Contacts have negotiated an agreement in principle to transfer the test suite to a stable home in W3C. In <cite>The QA Handbook</cite>, they find a <a shape="rect" href="#Acquire">handy checklist</a> of preliminary steps, requirements, and specific activities for a smooth transfer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Or maybe they need to take preemptive action due to looming possible license-issue hassles...</p>
    <div class="story">
        <p><span class="story-label">Story 4: Test suite licensing</span><br />
        A Working Group is almost ready to request Candidate Recommendation (<acronym title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</acronym>), and has gotten a comprehensive test suite together for <acronym title="Candidate Recommendation">the CR</acronym>'s trial implementation period. As the Chair starts to arrange for publication of the test suite, she finds the Working Group split on which test suite distribution licenses to use. Consulting <cite>The QA Handbook</cite>, she finds discussion of the <a shape="rect" href="#IANAL">pros and cons of the W3C licenses</a> (the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">Software License</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231">Document License</a>), and advice on devising an optimal licensing strategy.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Or maybe they can borrow the experience of other W3C Working Groups for various useful and common test suite processes...</p>
    <div class="story">
        <p><span class="story-label">Story 5: Test development processes</span><br />
        A Working Group has built and released a basic test suite for its specification. A Staff Contact has been given the Action Item to plan its expansion to a more comprehensive test suite, by leveraging and integrating the large test collections of several early implementors. Rather than figure out the issues and write a Test Contribution &amp; Review process from scratch, he looks at the <a shape="rect" href="#Test">summary advice</a> in <cite>The QA Handbook</cite>. <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> points him both to some useful templates, and to more detailed stuff in collected test guidance &mdash; <cite>Test Development FAQ</cite> [<a href="#TEST-FAQ">TEST-FAQ</a>] and Wiki pages [<a shape="rect" href="#TEST-WIKI">T</a><a href="#TEST-WIKI">EST-WIKI</a>] &mdash; significantly shortening his effort to complete his action item.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>1.2. <a shape="rect" name="why-qah" id="why-qah">Why <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym>?</a></h3>
    <p>Chairs and Staff Contacts are overworked. They share a lot of the same concerns and pressures as <a shape="rect" href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/QaFramework_2fSpecGlUsability">specification editors</a> (see 2.1, "Specification editors").</p>
    <p>Common problems include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>never enough motivated people to do the work;</li>
        <li>deliverables delivered late;</li>
        <li>licensing and legal hassles;</li>
        <li>too much to do, so little time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A lot of groups have faced these issues. As a result, there is a growing body of experience in W3C about what works and what doesn't. <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> aims to pull this together.</p>
    <h3>1.3. <a shape="rect" name="Audience" id="Audience">Audience and purpose</a></h3>
    <p><cite>The QA Handbook</cite> (<acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym>) is intended for: Chairs and Staff Contacts of W3C Working Groups. These include both the process-savvy as well as the novices.</p>
    <p><acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> is a practical guide about applying good practices and quality assurance techniques to WG activities, especially developing Recommendations and test materials. It flags avoidable pitfalls, and provides techniques, tools, and templates that will facilitate and accelerate the work of the groups. Guidance in QAH is supported by real-world stories and examples.</p>
    <p>There is no normative content in <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym>, therefore conformance to <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> is not an issue. <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> takes this approach because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the diversity amongst W3C's working groups makes it difficult to craft simple normative rules for all;</li>
        <li>in diverse, people-centric processes, it is more effective to encourage and help than to mandate and proscribe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Advice is presented in the imperative voice as <em>Guidelines</em> and <em>Good Practice</em>s. Guidelines tend to be general or high level encapsulations of a given topic area, and good practices tend to be more low-level, actionable details.</p>
    <p>These suggestions will generally be helpful and enhance the quality of the work of a Working Group. However, each suggestion should be applied or not depending on the specific situation of the WG.</p>
    <h3>1.4. <a shape="rect" name="scope" id="scope"><acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> scope</a></h3>
    <p><cite>The QA Handbook</cite> (<acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym>) is a non-normative handbook for integrating quality assurance techniques and good practices into the Working Group. It focuses especially on factors affecting development and implementation of specifications and tests, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>people resources;</li>
        <li>deliverables and their schedules;</li>
        <li>interaction with W3C and the world;</li>
        <li>W3C process, licenses, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Better specifications and effective test development are emphasized goals in QAH and its companion documents. In support of those goals, the scope of QAH goes beyond a narrow focus on authoring topics, and touches on many aspects of the broader context in which Working Groups operate -- from writing charters, to the logistics of managing the group's quality practices, to interacting with other groups and the public, to completion and maintenance of the Working Group's deliverables.</p>
    <h3>1.5. <a shape="rect" name="Other" id="Other">Other QA Framework resources</a></h3>
    <p><cite>The QA Handbook</cite> belongs to a document family collectively called the <cite>QA Framework</cite>. The other parts of the <cite>QA Framework</cite> are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><cite>QA Framework: Specification Guidelines</cite> [<a shape="rect" href="#QAF-SPEC">QAF-SPEC</a>]</li>
        <li><cite>Variability in Specifications</cite> [<a href="#VIS">VIS</a>]: advanced topics in support of <cite>Specification Guidelines</cite></li>
        <li><cite>QA Framework Primer</cite>[<a href="#QAF-PRIM">QAF-PRIM</a>]</li>
        <li>Test guidance: <cite>Test Development FAQ</cite> [<a href="#TEST-FAQ">TEST-FAQ</a>] and Wiki pages [<a shape="rect" href="#TEST-WIKI">TEST-WIKI</a>] on test-related topics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Editors, test builders, and W3C members in general, in addition to Chairs and Staff Contacts, will find advice specific to their roles in these other framework parts. The <cite>Primer</cite> provides a brief orientation to the whole <cite>QA Framework</cite>.</p>
    <p>Besides the <cite>QA Framework,</cite>other useful documents about quality assurance techniques and good practices are maintained in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Library/">QA Library</a> by the QA Activity.</p>
    <h3>1.6. <a shape="rect" name="Roadmap" id="Roadmap">Roadmap to the rest of <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym></a></h3>
    <p>After this orientation section, <acronym title="The QA Handbook">QAH</acronym> contains four topical modules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a shape="rect" href="#Early">Early planning and commitment</a></li>
        <li><a shape="rect" href="#Day-to-day">Day-to-day QA operations</a></li>
        <li><a shape="rect" href="#IANAL">Licensing &amp; branding</a></li>
        <li><a shape="rect" href="#Acquire">Acquiring test materials</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><a shape="rect">Each presents advice and guidance about tasks that contribute to the WG's realization of quality specifications and tests. These tend to have a chronological correspondence to phases (rec-track stages) of its activities.</a> Earlier is better, but later is better than never.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="practice">
        <p><span class="practice-label"><a id="gp-build-acquire" name="gp-build-acquire">Good Practice 1:</a></span> Decide as soon as possible &mdash; will the Working Group build test materials or acquire them?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="why-care">
        <p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span> Clearly, it is going to make a big difference in a Working Group's staffing requirements &mdash; building test materials tends to be labor intensive (extremely so for some types of specifications). Even if the group imports them, some resources will have to be applied (see the <a shape="rect" href="#Acquire">final module</a>). The particular test-related activities and milestones in its program of work will in general be completely different for build versus acquire options.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="practice">
        <p><span class="practice-label"><a id="gp-plan-deliverables" name="gp-plan-deliverables">Good Practice 2:</a></span> Think about and enumerate the <span class="vague-flag">quality-related deliverables</span> that might help the Working Group through the Recommendation track.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span>Minimally, the Working Group should commit to assuring the timely existence of test materials. <strong>Test materials</strong> provide for the evaluation of an implementation against the requirements of a specification and/or provide information about the implementation. <strong>Conformance Test Materials</strong> are test materials that are used to indicate conformance of an implementation to a specification. Note that all test materials are not conformance test materials. For example, some Working Groups using a test-driven specification development process emphasize tests of new, changed, or contentious functionality.</p>
        <p>Test Materials include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>test suites (tests, documentation and harness);</li>
            <li>validation tools;</li>
            <li>test assertions;</li>
            <li>sample code (in some cases);</li>
            <li>checklists;</li>
            <li>Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS) pro-forma.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a name="qual-deliverables" id="qual-deliverables">Quality-related deliverables</a> include:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>test materials;</li>
        <li>systematic, thorough reviews of specification;</li>
        <li>sample code (if not considered test material);</li>
        <li>model specification in formal language.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p>Test materials are by far the most common <span class="vague-flag">quality-related deliverable</span>, and likely will be a key to quick and painless passage through Candidate Recommendation (<acronym title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</acronym>).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="practice">
        <p><span class="practice-label"><a shape="rect" id="gp-sync-deliverables" name="gp-sync-deliverables">Good Practice 3:</a></span> Synchronize <span class="vague-flag">quality-related deliverables</span> and their development milestones with specification milestones.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> This advice echoes that in <cite><a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">Tips for Getting to Recommendation Faster</a></cite> [<a shape="rect" href="#REC-TIPS">REC-TIPS</a>] for example see item #6 in section 2. Quality related deliverables include especially test materials, but could include as well such other items as are <a href="#qual-deliverables">enumerated above</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="practice">
        <p><span class="practice-label"><a shape="rect" id="gp-advancement-criteria" name="gp-advancement-criteria">Good Practice 4:</a></span> Consider whether the Working Group should bind any <span class="vague-flag">quality criteria</span> to Rec-track advancement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> For example, finishing test materials deliverables before requesting Candidate Recommendation (<acronym title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</acronym>) is important, in order to facilitate <acronym title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</acronym>'s Implementation Assessment. (Counter-example: as in the <a shape="rect" href="#test-policy">above Story</a>, if the group is still building them during <acronym title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</acronym>, it is likely to uncover things that will oblige it to cycle in <acronym title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</acronym>.)</p>
        <p>This good practice takes the synchronization of deliverables of the <a href="#gp-sync-deliverables">previous Good Practice</a> a step further &mdash; the specification may not advance unless the committed <span class="vague-flag">test or other quality criteria</span> are met.</p>

        <p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>The earlier this is done, the more <a href="#Some">options</a> will be available. Charter-time <a href="#Staffing">staffing provisions of W3C Process</a>, by the way, provide another good reason to put some thought into test suite plans and other quality-related deliverables as early as possible.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>The third option is not really different from the first. It's just a way of doing it. But notice that it's an option that is only available by looking into these questions at Charter time.</p>
        <p><a id="Staffing" name="Staffing">By the way</a>, there has been confusion about "W3C Process only allows each company to have two participants on the Working Group". In fact, that is not from W3C Process. W3C Process gives considerable freedom for this to be tailored to Working Group needs &mdash; <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/policies.html#member-rep">W3C Process says</a> it may be specified in the Charter. So, for example, the group could decide on these rules: allow two per company in technical discussion, issue resolution, voting, etc; and, allow additional dedicated test suite builders.</p>

    <div class="technique">

        <p>The technique is simple: Use the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2004/08/QAH-qapd-root.html">QA Process Document template</a>. It will guide the user through everything needed, and then some. It is not only a template, but also a checklist of sorts, for the sort of things that the Working Group should consider having in its QA Process Document. The template has been assembled as the union of good practices seen in real QA Process Documents of W3C Working Groups.</p>
        <p>In the past, before this template, test efforts would often copy-edit an existing process document from another effort. There is not really any reason to do this anymore. Here are some examples from which the template has been assembled:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span> There are two kinds of licensing issues: submission license, and publication license. Both of them can be problematic and can interrupt the Working Group's progress on Rec-track if not early addressed and carefully handled. Test materials license issues are the subject of ongoing debate and discussion within W3C, but there are some tactics to minimize potential problems.</p>

    <div class="meaning">
        <p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span>W3C now has an official set of comprehensive <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html">policies for contribution of test cases</a> to W3C. (Formerly, it had a more or less routine submission license, <cite><a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/contribution-grant-20021231">Contribution of Software or Test Materials to W3C</a></cite> [<a shape="rect" href="#CONTRIB">CONTRIB</a>], but without policy.)</p>
        <p>By early attention, it should become clear whether any potential test sources have problems with the standard terms, before possible disputes can impact the Working Group's deliverables and schedules. There have been cases where potential submitters would not accept the standard terms.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="why-care">
        <p><span class="care-label">Why care?</span>Any W3C-hosted materials must have approved license and use terms. Experience has shown that there is no single license that is appropriate for all parts of all test materials, so the Working Group needs to address this after it has come to an understanding of the structure, content, and intended use of its test materials.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span>Currently approved W3C licenses that may be applied to test materials are the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231">Document License</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">Software License</a>. The Document License has two characteristics that are attractive for test materials:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It prohibits the test materials from being modified by the user upon download, therefore guaranteeing the integrity of the test materials;</li>
            <li>It requires that if the test materials are copied or redistributed, they must contain the link to the original test materials and their status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the other hand, there are situations in which the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231">Document License</a> is inappropriate, because (for example) some parts of the test materials require modification or completion in order to apply them.</p>
        <p>The W3C <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2004AprJun/0062.html">Advisory Board feels</a> (member-only link) that the Document License is the appropriate license for <strong>test cases</strong>.</p>
        <p>That ruling notwithstanding, test materials might contain some mixture of different components: test software, test documentation, and test cases. In some cases, one license may be appropriate for some component(s) of the test materials, but another license may be better for other parts. A careful look at the test materials' composition and use cases should reveal what is the best solution.</p>
        <p>The Working Group should consult with W3C Legal if it believes that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>neither the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231">Document License</a> nor the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">Software License</a> is applicable, not even piecewise as just described,</li>
            <li>or, contrary to the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2004AprJun/0062.html">Advisory Board's advice</a>, the Document License is inappropriate for the <strong>test cases</strong> component of its test materials</li>

    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p><span class="meaning-label">What does it mean?</span>There are two questions that the Working Group will face. First, whether to have logos, icons, or brands associated with its test materials. If that answer is yes, then it will have to address a series issues about proper usage of the logos.</p>
        <p><cite><a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/logo-usage-20000308.html">W3C Logo and Icon Usage</a></cite> contains a complete catalog of the logos in use within W3C. Of particular interest (related to conformance) are the logos associated with content validation (HTML, CSS, etc), Web Accessibility conformance, etc. These logos have associated issues of veracity and enforceability of conformance claims. A Working Group considering its own logo or brand will face similar issues, amongst which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>terms for valid application of the logo;</li>
            <li>relationship of the logo to conformance claims;</li>

The ABC Working Group had no test suite, no effort in progress, and no resources to staff a from-scratch effort. The external organization had no resources to continue maintaining the test suite. With a QA task-force moderating, several months of sorting the details led to a win-win agreement to transfer the ABC 1.0 test suite to the ABC working group. The test suite got a secure repository within W3C, was published for public use, and was given adequate maintenance resources.</a></p>

        <p>The license and human resources issues are similar in concept to what the Working Group faces when building test materials, but probably lesser in degree.
