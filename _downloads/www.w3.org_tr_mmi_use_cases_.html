<p>The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/mmi/">Multimodal
Interaction Activity</a> is developing specifications as a basis
for a new breed of Web applications in which you can interact using
multiple modes of interaction, for instance, using speech, hand
writing, and key presses for input, and spoken prompts, audio and
visual displays for output. This document describes several use
cases for multimodal interaction and presents them in terms of
varying device capabilities and the events needed by each use case
to couple different components of a multimodal application.</p>

<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Analysis of use cases provides insight into the requirements for
applications likely to require a multimodal infrastructure.</p>

<p>The use cases described below were selected for analysis in
order to highlight different requirements resulting from
application variations in areas such as device requirements, event
handling, network dependencies and methods of user interaction</p>

<p>It should be noted that although the results of this analysis we
be used as input to the Multimodal Specification being developed by
the W3C Multimodal Interaction Working Group, there is no guarantee
that all of these applications will be implementable using the
language defined in the specification.</p>

<h3 id="devices">1.1 Use Case Device Classification</h3>

<h4 id="thin">Thin Client</h4>

<p>A device with little processing power and capabilities that can
be used to capture user input (microphone, touch display, stylus,
etc) as well as non-user input such as GPS. The device may have a
very limited capability to interpret the input, for example a small
vocabulary speech recognition, or a character recognizer. The bulk
of the processing occurs on the server including natural language
processing and dialog management.</p>

<p>An example of such a device may be a mobile phone with DSR
capabilities and a visual browser (there could actually be thinner
clients than this).</p>

<h4 id="thick">Thick Client</h4>

<p>A device with powerful processing capabilities, such that most
of the processing can occur locally. Such a device is capable of
input capture and interpretation. For example, the device can have
a medium vocabulary speech recognizer, a handwriting recognizer,
natural language processing and dialog management capabilities. The
data itself may still be stored on the server.</p>

<p>An example of such a device may be a recent production PDA or an
in-car system.</p>

<h4 id="medium">Medium Client</h4>

<p>A device capable of input capture and some degree of
interpretation. The processing is distributed in a client/server or
a multidevice architecture. For example, a medium client will have
the voice recognition capabities to handle small vocabulary command
and control tasks but connects to a voice server for more advanced
dialog tasks.</p>

</table>

<h5 id="form-filling-details">Scenario Details</h5>

<p>User wants to make a flight reservation with his mobile device
while he is on the way to work. The user initiates the service via
means of making a phone call to a multimodal service (telephone
metaphore) or by selecting an application (portal environment
metaphore). The details are not described here.</p>

<p>As the user moves between networks with very different
characteristics, the user is offered the flexibility to interact
using the preferred and most appropriate modes for the situation.
For example, while sitting in a train, the use of stylus and
handwriting can achieve higher accuracy than speech (due to
surrounding noise) and protect privacy. When the user is walking,
the input and output modalities that more appropriate would be
voice with some visual output. Finally, at the office the user can
use pen and voice in a synergistic way.</p>

<p>The dialogue between the user and the application is driven by a
form-filling paradigm where the user provides input to fields such
as "Travel Origin:", "Travel Destination:", "Leaving on date",
"Returning on date". As the user selects each field in the
application to enter information, the corresponding input
constraints are activated to drive the recognition and
interpretation of the user input. The capability of providing
composite multimodal input is also examined, where input from
multiple modalities is combined for the interpretation of the
user's intent.</p>

<p>User wants to go to a specific address from his current location
and while driving wants to take a detour to a local restaurant (The
user does not know the restaurant address nor the name). The user
initiates service via a button on his steering wheel and interacts
with the system via the touch screen and speech.</p>

<h5 id="name-dialing-details">Scenario Details</h5>

<p>Janet presses a button on her multimodal phone and says one of
the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call Wendy</li>

<li>Call Wendy on her cell phone</li>

<li>Call Wendy at work</li>

<li>Call Wendy Smith at Acme Research</li>
</ul>

<p>The application initially looks for a match in Janet's personal
contact list and if no match is found then proceeds to look in
other directories. Directed dialog and tapered help are used to
narrow down the search, using aural and visual prompts. Janet is
able to respond by pressing buttons, or tapping with a stylus, or
by using her voice.</p>

<p>Once a selection has been made, rules defined by Wendy are used
to determine how the call should be handled. Janet may see a
picture of Wendy along with a personalized message (aural and
visual) that Wendy has left for her. Call handling may depend on
the time of day, the location and status of the both parties, and
the relationship between them. An "ex" might be told to never call
again, while Janet might be told that Wendy will be free in half an
hour after Wendy's meeting has finished. The call may be
automatically directed to Wendy's home, office or mobile phone, or
Janet may be invited to leave a message.</p>

<h2 id="use-case-details">2. Use Case Details</h2>

<h3 id="form-filling">2.1 Use-case: Form filling for air travel
reservation</h3>

<p>Description: The air travel reservation use case describes a
scenario in which the user books a flight using a wireless personal
mobile device and a combination of input and output modalities.</p>

<p>The device has a touch-enabled display (i.e., supports pen
input) and it is voice enabled. The use case describes a rich
multimodal interaction model that allows the user to start a
session while commuting on the train, continue the interaction
while walking to his office and complete the transaction while sat
at his office-desk. As the user moves between environments with
very different characteristics, the user is given the opportunity
to interact using the preferred and most appropriate modes for the
situation. For example, while sitting in a train, the use of stylus
and handwriting can offer higher accuracy than speech (due to
noise) and protect privacy. When the user is walking, the input and
output modalities more appropriate would be voice with some visual
output. Finally, at the office the user can use pen and voice in a
synergistic way.</p>

<p>This example assumes the seamless transition through a variety
of connectivity options such as high bandwidth LAN at the office
(i.e., 802.11), lower bandwidth while walking (i.e., cellular
network such as GPRS) and low bandwidth but in addition
intermittent connectivity while on the train (e.g., can get
disconnected when going through a tunnel). The scenario also takes
advantage of network services such as location and time.</p>

<h4 id="form-filling-actors">Actors</h4>

<ul>
<li>User who makes the air travel reservation</li>

<li>Mobile device with touch-enabled display wireless network
connectivity, handwriting recognition capability and limited voice
recognition capability on the device.</li>

<li>Network service with full voice dialog capabilities, connection
to travel reservation database and location/time services.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="form-filling-assumptions">Additional Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Data capabilities are available on the communications
provider's network. Voice requirements are satisfied either via
voice capabilities on the communications provider network or
through a DSR framework that utilized the existing data
capabilities.</li>

<li>There are means for describing user and device profile
information and means of exchanging this information between server
and client.</li>

<h3 id="name-dialing">2.3 Use Case: Multimodal Name Dialling Use
Case</h3>

<h4 id="name-dialing-overview">Overview</h4>

<p>The Name Dialing use case describes a scenario in which users
can say a name into their mobile terminals and be connected to the
named person based on the called party's availability for that
caller.</p>

<p>If the called user is not available, the calling user may be
given the choice of either leaving a message on the called user's
voicemail system or sending an email to the called user. The called
user may provide a personalized message for the caller, including,
for example, "Don't ever call me again!"</p>

<p>The called user is given the opportunity of selecting which
device the call should be routed to, e.g. work, mobile, home, or
voice mail. This may be dependent on the time of day, the called
user's location, and the identity of the calling user.</p>

<p>The use case assumes a rich model of name dialling as an example
of a premium service exploiting a range of information such as
personal and network directories, location, presence, buddy lists
and personalization features.</p>

<p>The benefits of making this a multimodal interacton include the
ability to view and listen to information about the called user,
and to be able to use a keypad or stylus, as an alternative to
using voice as part of the name selection process.</p>

<h4 id="name-dialing-actors">Actors</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Caller &mdash; user who wishes to place a call</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Called user &mdash; user who wishes control over how incoming
calls are handled</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Mobile display phone with a lightweight client browser, and
optional speaker-dependent minimal speech recognition
capabilities</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Network based directory service with speech recognition
capabilities, this provides support for looking up names in
personal contact lists, as well as in corporate and public
directories</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Network based unified messaging service with provision for
composing, transferring and playing back messages, including
personalized messages intended for specific callers</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>User profile database with presence information, buddy lists,
and personalized call handling rules</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="name-dialing-assumptions">Assumptions</h4>

<p>The user has a device with a button that is pushed to place a
call. The device has recording capabilities. [voice activation is
power hungry and unreliable in noisy environments]</p>

<p>Both voice and data capabilities are available on the
communications provider's network (not necessarily as
simultaneously active modes).</p>

<p>If the phone supports speech recognition and there is a local
copy of the personal phone contact list, then the user's spoken
input is first recognized against the local directory for a
possible match and if unsuccessful, the request is extended back to
the directory provider.</p>

<p>The directory provider has access to a messaging service and to
user profiles and presence information. The directory provider thus
knows the whereabouts of each registered user - on the phone, at
work, unavailable etc.</p>

<p>The directory provider enforces access control rules to ensure
individual and corporate privacy. This isn't explored in this use
case.</p>

<p>People can be identified by personal names like "Wendy" or by
nick names or aliases. The personal contact list provides a means
for subscribers to define their own aliases, and to limit the scope
of search (there are a lot of Wendy's worldwide).</p>

<p>There is a user agent on the client device with an XHTML browser
and optional speaker-dependent speech recognition capabilities.</p>

<p>There is a client server relationship between the user agent on
the device and the directory provider.</p>

<p>The dialog could be driven from either the client device or from
the network. This doesn't effect the user view, but does alter the
events used to coordinate the two systems. This will be explored in
a later section.</p>

<p>The Name Dialing use case will be described through the
following views:</p>

<h4 id="name-dialing-user-view">User view</h4>

<p>User pushes a button and says</p>

<pre>
  "Call Wendy Smith"
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to say such things as:</p>

<pre>
  "Call Wendy"

  "Call Wendy Smith at work".

  "Call Wendy at home".

  "Call Wendy Smith on her mobile phone".
</pre>

<p>Multiple scenarios are possible here:</p>

<p>If local recognition is supported, the utterance will be first
processed by a local name dialling application. If there is no
match, the recorded utterance is forwarded to a network based name
dialling application.</p>

<p>The user's personal contact list will take priority over the
corporate and public directories. This is independent of whether
the personal list is held locally in the device or in the
network.</p>

<p>The following situations can arise when the user says a
name:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Single match &mdash; the caller is presented with information
about the callee. This may include a picture taken from the
callee's profile. The caller is asked for a confirmation before the
call is put through.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multiple matches &mdash; if the number of matches is small
(perhaps five or less), the caller is asked to choose from the
list. This is be presented to the caller via speech and accompanied
with a display of a list of names and pictures. The caller can
then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a button on the phone to select a list item.</li>

<li>Point or touch a link on the screen in the presented list.</li>

<li>Say index number or expanded name from the presented list.</li>
</ul>

<p>A further alternative is to say "that one" as the system speaks
each item in the list in sequence. This method is offered in case
the user needs hands and eyes free operation, or the device is
incapable of displaying the list</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Lot's of matches, for example, when the caller says a common
name. The caller is led through a directed dialog to narrow down
the search.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>No recognition &mdash; the recognizer wasn't able to find a
match. The user could have failed to say anything, or there could
have been too much noise. A tapered help mechanism is invoked.
Callers could be asked to repeat themselves, or asked to key in the
number or speak it digit by digit.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming that the user successfully makes a selection:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The system retrieves further information on the called user such
as the current location and local time of that user. The
information presented may depend on the relationship between the
called and calling users. This assumes support for a buddy list and
presence capability. The called user may specify her availability
for specific individuals or groups of would be callers depending on
time of day etc.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Two scenarios are described here:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The system finds that the called person is currently available.
A picture and/or sound bite is provided to the caller. The system
places the call and the user is connected to Wendy Smith.</p>

<p><b>Post condition</b>: The user is in a call with the intended
party.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The system finds that the called person is unavailable. The
system attempts to connects to the called user's voicemail
system.</p>

<p>Assuming this succeeds, the system plays the following prompt
back to the caller: "Wendy Smith is currently unavailable. She has
left this message for you."</p>

<p>The message is played out. It could be a multimedia message with
recorded sound, text, pictures and even short video clips.</p>

<p>The system plays a prompt back - "Would you like to leave a
message?"</p>

<p>The user says "Yes".</p>

<p>The user is then connected to the voicemail system and leaves a
message for Wendy Smith.</p>

<p>If Wendy's voicemail box is full or unavailable, the system
offers the caller the chance of composing an email. This occupies
the caller's storage allocation until it has been sent.</p>

<p><b>Post condition</b>: The user has left a message for the
intended party.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The availability of the called user may depend on the time of
day, whether the called user is away from her work or home
location, and who the calling user is. For example, when travelling
you may want to take calls on your mobile during the day. Don't you
hate it when people call you in the middle of the night because
they don't realize what timezone you are in! You may want to make
an exception for close friends and family members. There may also
be some people whom you never want to accept calls from, not even
voice messages!</p>

<p>When a user is notified of an incoming call, the device may
present information on the caller including a photograph, name,
sound bite, location and local time information, depending on the
relationship between the caller and callee. The user then has an
opportunity to accept the call or to divert it to voice mail.</p>

<h4 id="name-dialing-provider-view">Directory provider View</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The client on the user device records the spoken input. The
spoken input is recognized against the directory on client device.
When this fails, the utterance is extended to the directory
provider for recognition.</p>

<p>If the user device doesn't support local recognition, it may
still need to record the utterance, so that the user can start
talking immediately without needing to wait for the connection to
the directory provider to be completed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The directory provider retrieves the profile for the calling
user. This has information on which device the user is calling
from, the current location of the calling user etc. The calling
user is authenticated and authorized.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The recognizer in the provider recognizes the spoken utterance
and returns the result. This result can either be a single entry or
a list of possible close matches.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The server application (hosting the directory provider) now
controls the flow of the interaction henceforth.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The server goes to the database and retrieves more information
based on the recognizer result.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The provider queries the presence of the called user, and
personalization information (buddy list, location and presence
information, etc.) to construct the content for the response.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A result may be returned back to the client device in more than
one way here:</p>

<p>A single XHTML page is constructed with both visual picture and
audio with the complete name of the recognized match.</p>

<p>The feedback can include two channels such as visual for the
picture and a separate voice channel for playing back the name of
the user (an optimization for reduced latency).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The server creates and transfers a composed page to the client
device.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once the client receives the content from the application
server, multiple scenarios are possible here based on the
recognizer result. See user view for details.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Picking a choice from a list can be done by voice, button or
stylus. The user should be able to browse the list, and to revisit
the list upon rejecting a confirmation of a preceding choice.</p>

<p>Example: user says "Call the first one". This utterance is
processed by the directory provider to select the first match.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The directory application may need to apply a directed dialog to
narrow the search when there are more than a few matches, or when
recognition and tapered help needs to be offered.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="name-dialing-initiative">What is driving the dialog?</h4>

<p>The details of the events depend on whether the dialog is being
driven from the network or from the user device.</p>

<p>When the device sends a spoken utterance to the server, the user
may have spoken a name such as "Tom Smith" or spoken a command such
as "the last one". If the directory search is being driven by the
user device, the server's response is likely to be a short list of
matches, or a command or error code. To support the application,
the server would provide a suite of functions, including the means
for the device to set the recognition context, the ability to play
specific prompts, and to download information on named users.</p>

<p>If the network is driving the dialog, the device sends the
spoken utterance in the same way, but the responses are actions to
update the display and local state. If the caller presses a button
or uses a stylus to make a selection, this event will be sent to
the server. The device and server could exchange low level events,
such as a stylus tap at a given coordinate, or higher level events
such as which name the user has selected from the list.</p>
