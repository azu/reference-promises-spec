    <section id='abstract'>
      This specification defines the common interface from which all device APIs are
      can be accessed as well as several interfaces that are commonly reused.
    </section>
    
    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines a single conformance class: that which comprises 
        <dfn title='user agent'>user agents</dfn> that support these interfaces.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>The <code>Device</code> interface</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>Device</a> interface is initially defined as an empty interface on which
        the various device APIs that are defined elsewhere graft themselves. A <a>user agent</a>
        supporting the <a>Device</a> interface MUST do so according to the following
        WebIDL [[!WEBIDL]] definition.
      </p>
      <dl title='[NoInterfaceObject] interface Device' class='idl'></dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The <code>NavigatorDevice</code> interface</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>NavigatorDevice</a> interface supplements the <a class='externalDFN'>Navigator</a>
        interface which is defined as part of HTML 5 [[!NAVIGATOR]]. A <a>user agent</a> MUST expose
        a <code>device</code> attribute that implements the <a>Device</a> interface on the 
        <code>navigator</code> object.
      </p>
      <dl title='[Supplemental, NoInterfaceObject] interface NavigatorDevice' class='idl'>
        <dt>readonly attribute Device device</dt>
        <dd>
          Returns the <a>Device</a> object which provides access to all the device APIs that
          the <a>user agent</a> exposes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <section>
        <h2>Integration with the <code>navigator</code> object</h2>
        <div class='idl' title='Navigator implements NavigatorDevice'></div>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The <code>PendingOp</code> interface</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>PendingOp</a> interface describes objects that are returned by asynchronous
        methods that are cancellable. It makes it possible to bring these operations to a
        stop if they haven't produced a result within a desired time or before a given
        event, thereby possibly reclaiming resources.
      </p>
      <dl title='[NoInterfaceObject] interface PendingOp' class='idl'>
        <dt>void cancel ()</dt>
        <dd>
          Cancel the pending asynchronous operation. When this method is called, the 
          <a>user agent</a> MUST immediately bring the operation to a stop and return.
        </dd>
      </dl>
