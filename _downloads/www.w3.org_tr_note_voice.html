<h2>Status of this document</h2>

<p>This document is a NOTE made available by the W3 Consortium for
discussion only. This indicates no endorsement of its content, nor
that the Consortium has, is, or will be allocating any resources to
the issues addressed by the NOTE.</p>

<p>This note describes features needed for effective interaction
with Web browsers that are based upon voice input and output.
Some extensions are proposed to HTML 4.0 and CSS2 to support
voice browsing, and some work is proposed in the area of speech
recognition and synthesis to make voice browsers more effective.</p>

<p>The minimal change needed to CSS2 is to allow literal text for
the cue-before and cue-after properties. For HTML 4.0, The accesskey
attribute needs to be added to the SELECT, OPTGROUP and OPTION
elements. This appears to be an oversight in the HTML 4.0
specification itself. 

<p>A couple of new events OnSelectionTimeout and OnSelectionError
are proposed to improve the ergnomics of the user interface for
voice browsers. A number of additional changes are needed for robust
speech recognition and high quality speech synthesis.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This note describes features needed for voice browsers. These
are browsers that exploit voice input and output, using speech
synthesis and prerecorded sound for output (together with small
displays when available), and a combination of keyboard and speech
recognition for input.

<p>The technology will make it practical to browse the Web from any
telephone. W3C has a major role to play in facilitating the
development of open standards for voice browsers, which are expected
to become available during the next year or so.</p>

<p>Voice browsers use speech synthesis and prerecorded material
to present the contents of Web pages. A variety of aural effects
can be used to give different emphasis to headings, hypertext
links, list items and so on.

<p>Users interact with voice browsers by spoken command or by
pressing a button on a keypad. Some commands interrupt the
browser. For instance to request a list of hypertext links
occurring in the current section of the document. Other
commands are given when the browser prompts for input, for
example, to select an option from a menu in a form.

<p>To increase the robustness of speech recognition, voice
browsers take advantage of contextual clues provided by
the author. This allows the recognition engine to focus on
likely utterances, improving the chances of a correct match.
Work is needed to specify how such contextual clues are
represented.

<p>Speech synthesis is driven by dictionaries, falling back for
unknown words on rules for regular pronunciation. High quality
speech synthesis is possible if the author can extend the dictionary
resident in the browser. 

<p>This should be practical without the author being a qualified
phonetician with a deep understanding of terms such as
<em>Labiodental</em>, and <em>Alveolo-palatal fricatives</em>. Work
is needed to establish a simple means for authors to specify how
particular words should be spoken.


<h3>Alternate Media</h3>

<p>Speech synthesis is not as good as having an actor read the
text. Content providers will inevitably want to provide prerecorded
content for some parts of Web pages.</p>

<p>Prerecorded content is analogous to the use of images in visual
Web pages. The same need for textual fall-backs applies for
printing, searching and access by users with disabilities.</p>

<p>Note that prerecorded content is likely to include music and
different speakers (think about radio adverts). These effects can
be reproduced to some extent via the aural style sheets features in
CSS<sup>[<a href="#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>]</sup>.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>Alternatives to using a mouse click:</p>

<p>For an application using a cellular phone, it would be
cumbersome to have to take the handset away from your ear to press
a button on the keypad. It therefore makes sense to support voice
input for navigation as an alternative to keyboard input.</p>

<p>At its simplest the user could speak the word "follow" when she
hears a hypertext link she wishes to follow. The user could also
interrupt the browser to request a short list of the relevant
links, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    <b>User</b>: <em>links?</em>

    <b>Browser</b>: The links are:

      1   company info
      2   latest news
      3   placing an order
      4   search for product details

    Please say the number now

    <b>User</b>: <em>2</em>

    <b>Browser</b>: Retrieving latest news ...
</pre>

<p>A more sophistocated voice browser would allow the user to say a
few words to indicate which link she is interested in. For example:
<em>I want to place an order</em>. The browser could use simple
template matching rules to select a matching link, akin to those
used in the AI program "Eliza" which mimics a conversation with a
therapist.</p>

<p>For this to work, the author is likely to need some control over
the speech recognition parameters. This control includes pointers
to vocabulary, template rules, definition of sensitivity and
more.</p>

<p class="note"><em>Another command could be used to request a list
of the document's headings. This would allow users to browse an
outline form of the document as a means to get to the section that
interests them.</em></p>

<h3>Forms and Input Fields</h3>

<p>Voice browsers will allow users to move between form fields and
to enter and review field values, using either the keyboard or
voice input.</p>

<p>Authors must be able to specify what spoken phrases should be
used for the selection of links, radio buttons, check boxes, image
buttons, submit buttons, and selection lists. (Key access is
already provided by the accesskey attribute in HTML 4 <sup>[<a
href="#ref-HTML4">HTML4</a>]</sup>).</p>

<h3>Handling Errors and Ambiguities</h3>

<p>In a voice based browser it is easy for the user to enter
unexpected or ambiguous input, or just to pause, providing no input
at all. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>when presented with a numbered list of links, the user enters a
number that is outside the range presented</li>

<li>the phrase uttered by the user matches more than one template
rule</li>

<li>the phrase/sound uttered doesn't match a known command</li>

<li>the user looses track and the browser needs to time-out and
offer assistance</li>
</ul>

<p>Authors must have control over the browser response to selection
errors and timeouts</p>

<h3>Aural Style Sheets</h3>

<p>Authors want control over how the document is rendered. Aural
style sheets (part of CSS2 <sup>[<a href="#ref-CSS2">
CSS2</a>]</sup>) provide a basis for controlling a range of
features, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Volume</li>

<li>Rate</li>

<li>Pitch</li>

<li>Direction</li>

<li>Suppressing output for specific elements</li>

<li>Spelling out text letter by letter</li>

<li>Speech fonts (male/female, adult/child etc.)</li>

<li>Inserted text before and after element content</li>

<li>Sound effects before, during and after elements, including
music or prerecorded sounds (e.g. sound of the sea breaking on the
shore)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inserted text</h3>

<p>When a hypertext link is spoken by a speech synthesiser, the
author may wish to insert text before and after the link's caption,
to guide the user's response.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;A href="driving.html"&gt;Driving instruction&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>May be offered by the voice browser using the following
words:</p>

<pre>
    For driving instructions press 1
</pre>

<p>The example shows how the words "For" and "Press 1" were added
to the text embedded in the anchor element.</p>

<p>On first glance it looks as if this 'wrapper' text should be
left for the voice browser to generate, but on further examination
you can easily find problems with this approach.</p>

<p>For example, how would you offer the following anchor
element?</p>

<pre>
    &lt;A href="LeaveMessage.html"&gt;Leave us a message&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>In the English language you could say</p>

<pre>
    To leave us a message, press 5
</pre>

<p>A safe assumption that other languages will have even more
structures and words which apply to special cases.</p>

<p>The CSS2 draft specification includes the means to provide
"generated text" before and after element content.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
    H1:before {content: "Chapter" decimal(chapno)
        display: block}
</pre>

<p>This relies on :before and :after psuedo elements to name the
positions, and the content property to provide the text to be
inserted. Unfortunately, this mechanism doesn't work with the HTML
style attribute.</p>

<p>You are therefore forced into using the STYLE element in the
document head:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
       #link1 :before {content: "For "}
       #link1 :after {content: ", press 1"}
       ...
       #link5 :before {content: "To "}
       #link5 :after {content: ", press 5"}
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       ...
    &lt;A id="link1" href="driving.html"&gt;Driving instruction&lt;/Agt;
       ...
    &lt;A id="link5" href="LeaveMessage.html"&gt;Leave us a message&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>It would be much more convenient if you could specify the text
to insert in a style attribute on the link itself. The <b>
cue-before</b> and <b>cue-after</b> properties in CSS2 as part of
the aural style sheet proposal seem ideal for this purpose:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;A style='cue-before: "To"; cue-after: ", press 5"'
         href=LeaveMessage.html&gt;Leave us a message&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you want to autonumber links include <b>%</b> in the cue
text. The % is expanded to "1", "2" or "3", and so on, according to
the order in which the link appears in the markup. The previous
example could be re-written as:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;A style='cue-before: "To"; cue-after: ", press %"'
         href=LeaveMessage.html&gt;Leave us a message&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p class="note"><em>We need to get CSS2 revised to extend
cue-before and cue-after to support literal text. They currently
can only be used with URLs for auditory icons.</em></p>

<table class="propinfo" summary="used to layout definition">
<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Property name:</th>
<td>'cue-after'</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Value:</th>
<td>&lt;url&gt; | "quoted string" | none</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Initial:</th>
<td>none</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Applies to:</th>
<td>all elements</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Inherited:</th>
<td>no</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Percentage values:</th>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>and</p>

<table class="propinfo" summary="used to layout definition">
<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Property name:</th>
<td>'cue-after'</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Value:</th>
<td>&lt;url&gt; | "quoted string" | none</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Initial:</th>
<td>none</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Applies to:</th>
<td>all elements</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Inherited:</th>
<td>no</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="right">Percentage values:</th>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>URLs are written in a functional notation <b>url(</b> <em>
url</em> <b>)</b>. This avoids any ambiguity with quoted
strings.</p>

<h3>Access Keys</h3>

<p>The HTML 4 accesskey attribute can in principle be used to
identify which key to press for a given link, for instance:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;A accesskey="5"
          style='cue-before: "To"; cue-after: ", press 5"'
          href=LeaveMessage.html&gt;Leave us a message&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>To ensure that the spoken cue matches the access key, the
accesskey attribute supports the same autonumbering mechanism as
cue-before and cue-after, for instance:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;A accesskey="%"
          style='cue-before: "To"; cue-after: ", press %"'
          href=LeaveMessage.html&gt;Leave us a message&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>The accesskey attribute needs to be added to the SELECT,
OPTGROUP and OPTION elements. This appears to be an oversight in
the HTML 4.0 specification itself.</p>

<p class="note"><em>What is missing is a media dependent way to
bind keys to particular links or form fields etc. Whether or not
this is an important omission needs to be resolved.</em></p>

<h3>Text to Speech</h3>

<p>Text to speech dictionaries contain information on how each word
is to be spoken by a speech synthesiser. This covers both phonemes
and prosody (stress). The pronunciation may depend on the context
in which a word occurs. As a result limited linguistic analysis may
be needed to determine which pronunciation applies.</p>

<p>For instance, in the example below, the word "read" is
pronounced as "red" in the first line and as "reed" in the second
line:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have <em>read</em> the first chapter.</li>

<li>I will <em>read</em> some more after lunch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Standard dictionaries for each language are likely to be
incomplete, missing irregular words for personal names, place
names, technical terms and abbreviations. For this reason, authors
need a way to provide supplementary text to speech information and
to indicate when it applies.</p>

<p>Specialized representations for phonemic and prosodic
information can be off putting for non-specialist users. For this
reason it is common to see simplified ways to write down
pronunciation, for instance, the word "station" can be defined
as:</p>

<p align="center"><big><b>station: stay-shun</b></big></p>

<p>This kind of approach is likely to encourage users to add
pronunciation information, leading to an increase in the quality of
spoken documents, as compared with more complex and harder to learn
approaches.</p>

<p>A language independent representation must cope with the full
range of sounds and stress patterns found in the world's languages.
A promising starting point is the International Phonetic Alphabet
<sup>[<a href="#ref-IPA">IPA</a>]</sup>. For greater flexibility in
representing prosodic information, it may be appropriate to define
a markup notation, based upon XML <sup>[<a href="#ref-XML">
XML</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>There is a strong case for W3C to facilitate the development of
a standard way to encode such information, bring together experts
from industry and academia. This will maximise the chances of
interoperability, and create a market for speech fonts and speech
synthesis software based upon open standards.</p>

<h2>Detailed Proposals</h2>

<h3>Voice Files</h3>

<p>One way to handle this is to use the OBJECT element to reference
the voice file with the content of the OBJECT element providing the
textual fall-back e.g.</p>

<pre>
    &lt;object data="advert.au" type="audio/basic"&gt;
      Hey there buddy, have you heard of the fantastic
      offers on cruises in the Carribean this winter?
      Get 50% off now from &lt;a href=horizon&gt;Horizon
      vacations and leave the big freeze behind!&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>

<p>The author might want to use an image for graphical browsers.
This could be represented as an outer OBJECT element for the image,
wrapping the audio object:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;object data="advert.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;object data="advert.au" type="audio/basic"&gt;
        Hey there buddy, have you heard of the fantastic
        offers on cruises in the Carribean this winter?
        Get 50% off now from &lt;a href=horizon&gt;Horizon
        vacations and leave the big freeze behind!&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;
    &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>

<p>The spoken word is generally as important as the written word.
This justifies a simple mechanism for speech as opposed to a more
general and inevitably more complex mechanism based upon metadata.
With this in mind, a particularly simple approach is to add an
attribute to HTML elements, that links to a voice file for use in
place of the element's content. This attribute could be used on
elements such as DIV, TABLE, and OBJECT. For instance:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;div voicefile="advert.au""&gt;
      Heh there buddy, have you heard of the fantastic
      offers on cruises in the Carribean this winter?
      Get 50% off now from &lt;a href=horiz&gt;Horizon
      vacations and leave the big freeze behind!&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Speech Recognition Grammar</h3>

<pre>
    Attibute name: grammar
    Value: <em>CDATA</em>
    Applies to: All elements
</pre>

<p>The "grammar" attribute allows the inclusion of a grammar block
with an input tag. The grammar block allows a speech recognition
engine to analyze different type of speech in a better way. At the
present, the proposal does not include the format of the block.
This will have to be done in coordination with the speech
recognition industry.</p>

<p>An HTML page may include a check box. The title of the check box
may be "Are you an American Citizen". A voice based user agent may
ask the user, with the help of a text to speech engine, "Are you an
American Citizen" The possible answers may be "Yes" or "No" but it
could also be any other word used for negative or positive response
in the caller's language. It could be "Ya," "you batch'ya," "sure,"
"of course" and many other expressions. It is necessary to feed the
speech recognition engine with likely utterances representing the
desired response.</p>

<p>When the page includes a sequence of hypertext links, a grammar
attribute supplied with an enclosing element (e.g. P, UL, LI or
DIV) can be used to provide recognition templates. This technique
can also be used together with the SELECT element for menus, and
for the FIELDSET element for groups of radio buttons and checkboxes
etc.</p>

<p class="note"><em>A template is a string with tagged slots that
either match any substring or which match a restricted set of
substrings. The approach offers much greater flexibility than
simple string matching.</em></p>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>

<p>An error response is an event generated by a element which
solicits input by talking to the user and waiting for input. Two
types of error response are proposed. An error for a situation
where no selection is made or no input is entered, and an error for
a case where a selection is made for something which is not
offered.</p>

<h4>OnSelectionTimeout</h4>

<p>The browser may generate an OnSelectionTimeout event when the
user is asked to provide input of any kind, such as a selection
from a list of anchors or an text input box and fails to do so
within a browser dependent time-out (settable via scripts).</p>

<p>For example, the following block may be offered the user for
navigation.</p>

<pre>
    &lt;P onselecttimeout='document.speak("You have
        not entered any selection, please enter your
        selection now")'&gt;
        &lt;A href=Instructions.html&gt;Directions&lt;/A&gt; |
        &lt;A href=Todo&gt;List of things to do&lt;/A&gt;
    &lt;/P&gt;
</pre>

<p>The OnSelectionTimeout event is processed by the browser
according to the browser own definition of timeout for input entry
or selection of anchor tags. The OnSelectTimeout event applies to
all block tags as well as form elements.</p>

<h4>OnSelectionError</h4>

<p>When the user selects an option not offered by the browser the
user must be notified that an error occurred. The notification and
the resulting action is to be performed by a script associated with
OnSelectionError event.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;P onselectionerror='document.speak("The selection
         you have entered is invalid, please enter your
         selection again now")'&gt;
        &lt;A href=Instructions.html&gt;Directions&lt;/A&gt; |
        &lt;A href=Todo&gt;List of things to do&lt;/A&gt;
    &lt;/P&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The format for the grammar block and for text to speech
information needs to be defined in consulation with experts from the
speech synthesis and recognition industry and centers of academic
research in this area. Perhaps the best way to move forward is to
discuss the issues presented in this Note in the W3C workshop on
Mobile Devices scheduled for April in Tokyo.</p>

<p>The workshop could be followed by setting up one or more
working groups. Another possibility would be to issue a briefing
package and a call for participation in working groups prior to
holding the workshop.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it may be practical for the proposals for
inserted text, voicefiles and error responses to be reviewed in the
existing W3C groups, in particular, the Web Accessibility
Initiative, the CSS &amp; FP working group and the HTML
coordination group.</p>
