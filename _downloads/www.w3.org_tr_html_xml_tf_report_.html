<h3><a name="introduction" id=
"introduction"></a>1&#160;Introduction</h3>
<p>HTML and XML share a common ancestor in SGML. The precise
details of that ancestry are not strictly important, its
significant consequence is that HTML and XML have a quite similar
surface syntax. Both use angle brackets and ampersands to
distinguish “markup” characters from “content” characters. Both
have elements which contain other content and elements which are
empty.</p>
<p>This high level of surface similarity suggests, at least to some
and at least at first, that there should be a high level of
interoperability between HTML and XML systems. This notion is
amplified by the fact that when XML arrived on the scene, well
after HTML was widely deployed, efforts were made to recast HTML as
an XML application rather than an SGML application. HTML was never
broadly implemented as an “SGML application”, but it was defined as
one in the early HTML specifications.</p>
<p>However, if you look beyond those high-level generalities, the
languages are quite different and serve quite different purposes.
Where HTML is a single language, XML is a framework for defining
languages. Where HTML defines how a tree is constructed from any
input, XML only defines tree construction for a small subset of all
possible inputs. Where HTML defines explicit extension points
within a single vocabulary, XML encourages the use of multiple
vocabularies defined in a distributed fashion. Where HTML is in a
small, explicit set of namespaces, XML provides for an unbounded
number of namespaces.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of this tension, the TAG formed this Task
Force in order to explore how interoperability between HTML and XML
could be improved. The Task Force worked in public; an archive of
its deliberations <a href=
"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-xml/">is
preserved</a>. The Task Force began by collecting use cases to
focus its efforts. The original expectation was that a set of use
cases would highlight those areas where additional work could aid
in the interoperability between XML and HTML. However, as all of
the use cases appear to have plausible solutions today, solutions
that do not appear amenable to significant improvement, it appears
that there is little that can be done beyond documenting these
circumstances.</p>
<p>In the following section, we'll describe a set of use cases that
the Task Force considered, and how the needs of those use cases can
be met today. Additional notes and other background material for
many of these use cases is available in <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_XML_Use_Cases">the wiki</a> that the
Task Force used to organize its early notes. Readers are
particularly encouraged to report additional use cases that they
feel are not represented or specific examples where the solutions
outlined are not appropriate.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="terminology" id=
"terminology"></a>1.1&#160;Terminology</h4>
<p>A few notes about about terminology:</p>
<p>In general, we refer the family of documents that are
colloquially understood to be HTML (HTML, XHTML, HTML5) using the
term “HTML”. In those cases where we want to draw attention to
XHTML or HTML5 specifically, we use the more specific terms.</p>
<p>There are a great many ways to represent the “object model” of
an HTML or XML document. There are specifications for both abstract
and concrete representations. As a simplification, we use the term
“DOM” (Document Object Model) throughout as a general term for any
of these possible representations.</p>
<p>An “HTML parser” is one that consumes HTML markup and produces a
DOM. We use the term “HTML5 parser” in those cases where we wish to
draw attention explicitly to the parsing behaviors described by
[<a href="#HTML5"><span class="abbrev">HTML5</span></a>]. An “XML
parser” is one that consumes well-formed XML and produces a
DOM.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="usecases" id="usecases"></a>2&#160;Use Cases</h3>
<p>The task force set out to examine a number of <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_XML_Use_Cases">use cases</a> for a
world in which XML and HTML are both important. These are outlined
in the following sections.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="uc01" id="uc01"></a>2.1&#160;How can an XML toolchain
be used to consume HTML?</h4>
<div class="section" id="uc01p">
<p><b>Problem statement</b> A great many systems exist which
process XML. These include, but are not limited to, validation
tools, a broad spectrum of editors, browsers, query and
transformation languages, and countless ad hoc tools. Many of these
tools could be applied equally to HTML content, if such content was
accessible to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uc01r">
<p><b>Resolution</b> The principal impediment to using XML tools
with HTML is that HTML is not guaranteed (or even likely, in the
context of the internet at large) to be well-formed. XML parsers
reject documents which are not well-formed, so the overwhelming
majority of HTML documents cannot be used by systems which only
process XML.</p>
<p>The Task Force found two approaches to address this problem: use
polyglot markup or introduce an HTML parser into your processing
toolchain.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/">Polyglot
markup</a> refers to documents which have been carefully crafted
such that they are simultaneously XML and HTML compatible. It seems
that the world at large is unlikely to adopt polyglot markup as the
standard way to encode all HTML documents, so this solution has
limited applicability.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of HTML documents <em>could</em> be
written using polyglot markup and doing so would make them
immediately available for processing by tools that anticipate
either XML or HTML markup. If you have control over the authoring
environments that are used to create content for your system, then
it may be entirely feasible to address the “consume HTML with XML
tools” problem simply by being more careful about the HTML that you
produce.</p>
<p>Where it is applicable, polyglot markup constrains the
<tt class="literal">text/html</tt> content in such a way that when
parsed as XML, it produces the same parse tree (except for certain
minor, specified differences) as it would produce if parsed using
an implementation of the HTML parsing algorithm.</p>
<p>Alternatively, rather than attempting to constrain the HTML
input so that it conforms to the polyglot constraints, an HTML
parser can be introduced to the front of the XML toolchain. Such a
parser reads the HTML markup “as she is writ” in the world at large
and produces a representation of that tree that an XML processor
can use. It <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-end.html#coercing-an-html-dom-into-an-infoset">
is still possible</a> to encounter HTML documents whose document
tree needs to be modified slightly for the document tree to be
representable as XML. For conforming input, the modifications are
on the level of replacing form feeds with spaces.</p>
<p>Like XML parsing, HTML parsing produces a tree. Exposing that
tree to the XML toolchain (as a sequence of events, such as SAX
events, or an in-memory tree model, or through any other
appropriate implementation mechanism) makes all of the XML power
available to any HTML document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="uc02" id="uc02"></a>2.2&#160;How can an HTML toolchain
be used to consume XML?</h4>
<div class="section" id="uc02p">
<p><b>Problem statement</b> HTML toolchains will become widespread
and popular. Users may encounter XML documents and want to process
them using familiar tools. This use case is the logical reciprocal
of the former use case; it's about allowing developers of HTML-only
tools to provide useful functionality to users who have non-XHTML,
non-SVG, non-MathML content, even though the tool developer doesn't
have a business need to address it explicitly.</p>
<p>(If the XML in question is entirely XHTML or XHTML with only SVG
and MathML embedded, then the differences are likely to be small
and the HTML toolchain is likely to do the right thing; the focus
of this use case is on XML vocabularies that are not in the HTML
family.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uc02r">
<p><b>Resolution</b> HTML5 doesn't have an extensibility story that
admits the possibility of content in arbitrary namespaces. XML
markup from vocabularies totally unlike HTML, SVG, or MathML will
be parsed and interpreted according to the HTML5 rules. These rules
are very unlikely to produce the same DOM that an XML parser would
have produced.</p>
<p>For XML content that needs to be textually embedded in HTML5,
the most successful approach may be to simply translate the XML to
HTML5 before passing it to the HTML5 tool. A wide variety of XML
tools exist to simplify the technical challenge of transforming
XML; of course, the semantic challenge of translating an arbitrary
XML vocabulary into HTML5 may be very difficult. If a faithful
translation isn't possible, even the simple transformation that
strips out processing instructions and non-HTML namespaces may
help.</p>
<p>Processing a real XML document with an HTML5 parser is probably
never going to be possible with complete fidelity.</p>
<p>In an environment where the HTML toolchain includes access to an
XML parser and the HTML and XML resources can be managed
separately, the most successful approach is likely to involve
parsing the XML with an XML parser and the HTML with an HTML
parser.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="uc03" id="uc03"></a>2.3&#160;How can islands of HTML
be embedded in XML?</h4>
<div class="section" id="uc03p">
<p><b>Problem statement</b> In XML vocabularies that are
<em>not</em> intrinsically about representing prose, it's often
useful to provide elements into which documentation or “prose
annotations” can be provided. One common design pattern in these
cases is to establish HTML as one of the common vocabularies
marking up documentation in those elements.</p>
<p>This pattern establishes the practice of embedding islands of
HTML in XML documents that are not otherwise anything like HTML or
intended to be processed directly by HTML tools.</p>
<p>The question naturally arises, how can HTML5 be embedded in an
XML document?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uc03r">
<p><b>Resolution</b> Broadly speaking, there are two techniques for
addressing the question of how HTML is to be embedded in XML.</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Make sure that the HTML markup is well-formed XML. This is
typically done by explicitly or implicitly asserting that the
content is XHTML. This makes the HTML a natural part of the XML
document at the expense of imposing XML markup requirements on the
author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the container element, escape all characters that might
be interpreted as markup. This absolves the author of the
responsibility to construct well-formed XML, at the expense of
requiring tools to escape and unescape the markup and support
non-well-formed markup “downstream”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Both of these techniques can be applied to HTML5 markup. In the
former case, use the XML serialization of HTML5. In the latter
case, escape the HTML5 markup.</p>
<p>If the HTML subsystem has an interface that allows document
trees to be passed to it, the XHTML subtree should be extracted
from the larger XML tree and passed to the HTML subsystem. If the
HTML subsystem only accepts HTML source text as its input, the
XHTML subtree needs to be serialized as HTML and passed to the HTML
subsystem for parsing using an HTML parser. In the latter case,
some non-conforming constructs may not round-trip to the same tree
shape when serialized as HTML and reparsed as HTML. Also,
conforming trees that have <tt class="tag-element">tr</tt> elements
as children of <tt class="tag-element">table</tt> elements will be
replaced with semantically equivalent but tree-wise different
constructs where the <tt class="tag-element">tr</tt> elements gain
a <tt class="tag-element">tbody</tt> parent which is a child of the
<tt class="tag-element">table</tt>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="uc04" id="uc04"></a>2.4&#160;How can islands of XML be
embedded in HTML?</h4>
<div class="section" id="uc04p">
<p><b>Problem statement</b> In principle, the same powerful
scripting and styling facilities that allow users to create rich
internet applications with HTML5 can operate on XML documents.
Users may attempt to engage in a “progressive enhancement” strategy
for building such applications by adding islands of more richly
structured XML markup to existing HTML5 documents.</p>
<p>The user's expectation is that these XML islands will appear in
the DOM where they can be addressed with JavaScript and formatted
with CSS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uc04r">
<p><b>Resolution</b> In fact, this is not the case for content
served as <tt class="code">text/html</tt>. When an HTML5 parser
encounters unfamiliar markup, it assumes that such markup is an
erroneous attempt to generate well-defined HTML5. Consequently, it
applies error correction strategies which result in a DOM
representation that can differ radically from the DOM that an XML
parser would have produced. In particular, open elements may end
prematurely and additional elements may be opened.</p>
<p>The practical result is that a “naked” XML island in an HTML5
document will not reliably produce anything that resembles the DOM
one would expect from casual inspection of the XML island.</p>
<p>In order to conceal the XML markup from an HTML5 parser's
attempts to correct errors, the XML must be stored within a
<tt class="tag-element">script</tt> element. The script can
identify the content as XML by specifying the content type
“<tt class="literal">application/xml</tt>” or any other applicable
media type.</p>
<p>What an HTML5 parser produces when it processes this script
element is a <tt class="literal">script</tt> element node in the
DOM which contains the literal character representation of the XML.
That representation can be extracted by JavaScript when the page is
loaded, parsed into an actual XML DOM, and processed by the
application.</p>
<p>This technique allows arbitrary XML islands to be embedded in
HTML5, but such islands are only accessible to processors that are
able and willing to execute the necessary JavaScript shim.</p>
<p>Note: XHTML content served as <tt class=
"code">application/xhtml+xml</tt> is, in fact, XML and so embedded
islands of richly structured XML markup are preserved. Serving XML
content to user agents carries its own set of problems, however.
Note also that polyglot markup is not an aid here as it forbids
arbitrary XML content from the document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="uc05" id="uc05"></a>2.5&#160;How can XML be made more
forgiving of errors?</h4>
<div class="section" id="uc05p">
<p><b>Problem statement</b> Some significant portion of HTML5 is
generated by server-side tools that do little more than
string-concatenation. Markup generated by naive string
concatenation often results in minor markup errors. An HTML5 parser
consistently (and often correctly) corrects for these mistakes and
constructs a useful DOM from a not-quite-perfectly constructed
inputs.</p>
<p>An XML parser is utterly unforgiving in the face of even small
markup errors. As a result, XML constructed using otherwise
straightforward techniques in many programming languages is
sometimes not well-formed unless great care is taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uc05r">
<p><b>Resolution</b> This aspect of XML parsing could be addressed
by a more lenient parser (such as XML5). Working out all of the
details to assure that the necessary error correction produces
expected results in all cases might be tedious, but some efforts
have already been undertaken to examine the issue. However, it's
entirely unclear that the XML community would be motivated to adopt
such changes and, in any event, making such proposals is outside
the scope of this Task Force.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="conclusions" id=
"conclusions"></a>3&#160;Conclusions</h3>
<p>The Task Force considered several areas of interoperability that
arose in these use cases: consuming HTML with XML tools, consuming
XML with HTML tools, and embedding islands of one within the other.
As described above, there are well understood boundaries within
which any solution to each use case can operate. And within those
boundaries, there exists today a solution that, while perhaps not
wholly satisfactory, sits within those boundaries. No wholly
satisfying solution appears possible within the accepted
constraints; it would appear that we have already achieved the
practical solutions.</p>
<p>With respect to the question of making XML more forgiving to
errors, it's clear that some work has been done in this area and
that it is possible to articulate coherent proposals for such
change. We recommend further study within the XML community before
determining how best to explore these changes.</p>
<p>On the question of Polyglot markup, there seems to be little
consensus. One line of argument suggests that, to the extent that
it is practical to obey the <a href=
"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Robustness_Principle">
Robustness principle</a>, it makes sense to do so. That is, if
you're generating HTML markup for the web, and you can generate
Polyglot markup that is also directly consumable as XML, you should
do so. Another line of argument suggests that even under the most
optimistic of projections, so tiny a fraction of the web will ever
be written in Polyglot that there's no practical benefit to
pursuing it as a general strategy for consuming documents from the
web. If you want to consume HTML content, use an HTML parser that
produces an XML-compatible DOM or event stream.</p>
