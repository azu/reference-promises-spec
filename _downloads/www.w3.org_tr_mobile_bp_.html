<h3><a name="d0e163" id="d0e163"/>1.3 Audience</h3><p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies.</p><p>Our intention is to make it clear to all involved what the Best Practices are, and hence establish a common basis of understanding. As a result of wishing to be clear to those not already involved in the development of mobile friendly content, some of our statements may appear to be obvious or trivial to those with experience in this area.</p><p>The document is not targeted solely at developers; others, such as interaction and graphic designers are encouraged to read it.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e172" id="d0e172"/>1.4 Scope</h3><p>The scope of these Best Practices is laid out in "Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices" <a href="#Scope">[Scope]</a>. In summary, this document refers primarily to the extension of Web browsing onto mobile devices.</p><p>The Best Practice recommendations refer to delivered content. While they are clearly relevant to the processes of content creation and rendering on devices, they are not intended to be Best Practices for those activities.</p><p>As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for delivery to mobile devices, statements that do not have a specific mobile aspect are not included. In particular, many Web Content Accessibility <a href="#WCAG">[WCAG]</a> guidelines are general to all forms of Web access and are not repeated here unless they have a specific mobile interpretation. Examples of general good practice which have a specific mobile interpretation include "Error Messages" and "Color". </p><p>See <a href="#related"><b>B Related Reading</b></a> for information about the related topics of Internationalization, Web Accessibility and Device Independence.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="phasing" id="phasing"/>1.4.1 Phasing</h4><p>As discussed in the Scope document <a href="#Scope">[Scope]</a> there are many  aspects to Mobile Web Best Practices. At present, for example, the design and construction of many Web sites and pages make for a poor user experience when they are viewed on a mobile device.</p><p>The quality of the user's Web experience via a mobile device depends significantly on the usability of Web sites, of browsers, and of the device itself. Although browser usability  and device usability are important (for reading, navigating, and interacting with content), this document focuses primarily on Best Practices for improving site usability.</p><p>In future phases other aspects may be considered - e.g. Best Practices as applied to  adaptation and devices. Also in future phases the scope of the recommendations may be extended beyond "Traditional Web Browsing" into fields such as multimodal interaction.</p></div></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e201" id="d0e201"/>1.5 Relationship to other Best Practices and recommendations</h3><p>These recommendations are in part derived from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <a href="#WCAG">[WCAG]</a>. As noted above, WCAG guidelines are supplementary to the Mobile Web Best Practices, whose scope is limited to matters that have a specific mobile relevance.</p><p>This document builds on some of the concepts described by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/di/">Device Independence Working  Group</a> (DIWG) in the Device Independence Principles <a href="#DIP">[DIP]</a>. The document discusses device and delivery channel characteristics, which the DIWG has named "Delivery Context"  <a href="#DCODI">[DCODI]</a>. In addition, the document uses some terminology from DIWG's Glossary of Terms for  Device Independence <a href="#DIGLOSS">[DIGLOSS]</a>.</p><p>The BPWG <span>is developing</span> a companion document describing techniques <a href="#Techniques">[Techniques]</a> by which the Best Practice statements in this document can be implemented.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e226" id="d0e226"/>1.6 Longevity and Versioning</h3><p>The Best Practices have been written at a level of generality that allows them to be applicable across a range of markup languages. They have been written with enduring properties of mobile access to the Web in mind. While the factors identified in <a href="#ddc">3.7 Default Delivery Context</a>, such as screen dimensions, will change over time, it seems likely that the distinguishing features of mobile access such as cost and difficulty of input will remain issues.</p><p>This document may be reviewed from time to time. When necessary, an updated version will be released with clear documentation as to the changes that have been introduced.</p></div></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="requirements" id="requirements"/>2 Requirements</h2><p>This section discusses the requirements of the Mobile Web Best Practice statements in section 5. The statement of requirements is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive or complete.</p><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e240" id="d0e240"/>2.1 Presentation Issues</h3><p>Today, Many Web pages are laid out for presentation on desktop size displays, and exploit capabilities of desktop browsing software.</p><p>Accessing such a Web page on a mobile device often results in a poor or unusable experience. Contributing factors include pages not being laid out as intended. Because of the limited screen size and the limited amount of material that is visible to the user, context and overview are lost.</p><p>Because of the limited screen size, the subject matter of the page may require considerable scrolling to be visible, especially if the top of the page is occupied by images and navigation links. In these cases the user gets no immediate feedback as to whether their retrieval has resulted in the right content.</p><p>It is particularly important in the mobile context to help the user create a mental image of the site. This can be assisted by adopting a consistent style <span>and can be considerably diminished by an uneven style.</span></p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e253" id="d0e253"/>2.2 Input</h3><p>Mobile device input is often difficult when compared with use of a desktop device equipped with a keyboard. Mobile devices often have only a very limited keypad, with small keys, and there is frequently no pointing device.</p><p>One of the difficulties of the mobile Web is that URIs are very difficult to type. Lengthy URIs and those that contain a lot of punctuation are particularly difficult to type correctly. </p><p>Because of the limitations of screen and input, forms are hard to fill in. This is because navigation between fields may not occur in the expected order and because of the difficulty in typing into the fields.</p><p>While many modern devices provide back buttons, some do not, and in some cases, where back functionality exists, users may not know how to invoke it. This means that it is often very hard to recover from errors, broken links and so on.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e264" id="d0e264"/>2.3 Bandwidth and Cost</h3><p>Mobile networks can be slow compared with fixed data connections and often have a measurably higher latency. This can lead to long retrieval times, especially for lengthy content and for content that requires a lot of navigation between pages.</p><p>Mobile data transfer often costs money. The fact that mobile devices frequently support only limited types of content means that a user may follow a link and retrieve information that is unusable on their device.</p><p>Even if the content type can be interpreted by their device there is often an issue with the experience not being satisfactory - for example, larger images may only be viewable in small pieces and require considerable scrolling.</p><p>Web pages can contain content that the user has not specifically requested - especially advertising and large images. In the mobile world this extra material contributes to poor usability and may add considerably to the cost of the retrieval.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="UserGoals" id="UserGoals"/>2.4 User Goals</h3><p>Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed or desktop devices. They are likely to have more immediate and goal-directed intentions than desktop Web users. Their intentions are often to find out specific pieces of information that are relevant to their context. An example of such a goal-directed application might be the user requiring specific information about schedules for a journey they are currently undertaking.</p><p>Equally, mobile users are typically less interested in lengthy documents or in browsing. The ergonomics of the device are frequently unsuitable for reading lengthy documents, and users will often only access such information from mobile devices as a last resort, because more convenient access is not available.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e282" id="d0e282"/>2.5 Advertising</h3><p>Developers of commercial Web sites should note that different commercial models are often at work when the Web is accessed from mobile devices as compared with desktop devices. For example, some mechanisms that are commonly used for presentation of advertising material (such as pop-ups, pop-unders and large banners) do not work well on small devices and are therefore contrary to Best Practice recommendations such as [CENTRAL_MEANING], [LARGE_GRAPHICS] and [POP_UPS].</p><p>It is not the intention of the MWI to limit or to restrict advertising; rather it is the intention that the user experience of the site as a whole, including advertising, if any, is as effective as possible.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e289" id="d0e289"/>2.6 Device Limitations</h3><p>As noted above, the restrictions imposed by the keyboard and the screen typically require a different approach to page design than for desktop devices. As detailed in the Scope document <a href="#Scope">[Scope]</a>, various other limitations may apply and these have an impact on the usability of the Web from a mobile device.</p><p>Mobile browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins, which means that the range of content that they support is limited. In many cases the user has no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible.</p><p>Some activities associated with rendering Web pages are computationally intensive - for example re-flowing pages, laying out tables, processing unnecessarily long and complex style sheets and handling invalid markup <a href="#T-MOB">[T-MOB]</a>. Mobile devices typically have quite limited processing power which means that page rendering may take a noticeable time to complete. As well as introducing a noticeable delay, such processing uses more power as does communication with the server.</p><p>Many devices have limited memory available for pages and images, and exceeding their memory limitations results in incomplete display and can cause other problems.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e304" id="d0e304"/>2.7 Advantages</h3><p>In discussing the limitations of mobile devices for delivery of Web content it is easy to lose sight of the fact that they are extremely popular and very common.</p><p>This popularity largely stems at present from them being:</p>
<ul><li><p>personal</p></li><li><p>personalizable</p></li><li><p>portable</p></li><li><p>connected</p></li></ul>
<p>and increasingly multi-functional beyond their original purpose of voice communications.</p><p>In addition to these factors, the advantages of mobile devices will increasingly include:</p>
<ul><li><p>location awareness</p></li><li><p>one-handed operation</p></li><li><p>always on</p></li><li><p>universal alerting device</p></li></ul>
<p>By way of illustration of some of these factors: the Web can go where you go. You do not have to remember to do something on the Web when you get back to your computer. You can do it immediately, within the context that made you want to use the Web in the first place.</p><p>Moreover, with mobile devices appearing in all shapes and forms, and  with a growing variety of features like location technology, cameras, voice recognition, touch screens etc, the Web can reach a much wider audience, and at all times in all situations. It has the opportunity to reach into places where wires cannot go, to places previously unthinkable (e.g. providing medical info to mountain rescue scenes) and to accompany everyone as easily as they carry the time on their wristwatches.</p><p>Finally, today, many more people have access to mobile devices than access to a desktop computer. This is likely to be very significant in developing countries, where Web-capable mobile devices may play as similar a role in deploying wide-spread Web access as the mobile phone has played for providing "plain old telephone service".</p></div></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="d0e347" id="d0e347"/>3 Delivery Context</h2><p>
				<em>Delivery Context</em> is used with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-delivery-context-v2">specific meaning</a> defined in the Device Independence Glossary <a href="#DIGLOSS">[DIGLOSS]</a>.</p><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="OneWeb" id="OneWeb"/>3.1 One Web</h3><p>The recommendations in this document are intended to improve the experience of the Web on mobile devices. While the recommendations are not specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience, it must be understood that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards "One Web". </p><p>As discussed in the Scope document <a href="#Scope">[Scope]</a>, <em>One Web</em> means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-representation">representation</a> across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts (see <a href="#tc">5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI</a>).</p><p>Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example).</p><p>It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations.</p><p>From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available as some variant of HTML over HTTP (see <a href="#ddc">3.7 Default Delivery Context</a>).</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="ca" id="ca"/>3.2 Background to Adaptation</h3><p>The widely varying characteristics of mobile devices can make it difficult for a Web site to provide an acceptable user experience across a significant range of devices. For example different devices support different markup features and different screen sizes may demand different sized images. Consequently, it is very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the details of the markup, format of images, image sizes, color depths and so on to suit the characteristics of the device in question. The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on particular devices is referred to as <em>Content Adaptation</em>.</p><p>We do not describe adaptation in detail in this document. For a more detailed description, readers are referred to the Device Independence Principles <a href="#DIP">[DIP]</a>.</p><p>In addition, the sister group of the Best Practices Working Group, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/DDWG/">Device Description Working Group</a>, is currently defining requirements for a repository of mobile device characteristics that are relevant to content adaptation.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e402" id="d0e402"/>3.3 Adaptation Implementation Model</h3><p>There are a number of different implementation models for content adaptation. On the one hand, adaptation may be quite simple and consist of determining the device type and choosing the most appropriate set of previously prepared content to match the device characteristics. At the other extreme it may be carried out in a completely dynamic way, with content formatted at the time of retrieval, taking into account not only statically determined properties, such as screen dimension, but also dynamically determined properties, such as the temporary attachment of a fully featured keyboard. </p><p>Adaptation can be carried out in a number of different points in the delivery of content to the device <a href="#DCODI">[DCODI]</a>:</p><p>
					<em>Server Side</em> adaptation implies that the content is delivered by the originating content server or application.</p><p>
					<em>In-Network</em> adaptation is where the content is altered as it passes through one or more network components. Some network operators, for example, compress images before they are passed over the air to the mobile device.</p><p>
					<em>Client Side</em> adaptation consists of the device accepting content and displaying it in an appropriate way for its characteristics.</p><p>Whatever the adaptation model at work, the process of adaptation should not diminish accessibility.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e428" id="d0e428"/>3.4 Assumptions about Adaptation</h3><p>In phase 1 (See <a href="#phasing">1.4.1 Phasing</a>) it is assumed that content adaptation, if any, is carried out Server Side. Future phases may consider the implications of content adaptation elsewhere, especially the issues concerning the granting of authority to third parties to carry out adaptation, prohibiting adaptation and so on. Later phases may also address multiple adaptation - i.e. the possibility that adaptation can be applied at more than one point and that In-Network adaptation may occur more than once.</p><p>It is also assumed that it is possible to create a site that is consistent with the Best Practice recommendations without carrying out adaptation at all. However it is likely that a more sophisticated and enhanced user experience will be achieved if adaptation is used.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e437" id="d0e437"/>3.5 Establishing Context</h3><p>Providing variations on the user experience that are appropriate in different cases requires the content provider to know a significant amount about the characteristics of the device, the properties of the browser in use and the transparency of the network connection to the device.</p><p>For simple sites that present an interface which is similar across a broad range of contexts the need for such information is diminished when compared with a sophisticated site that has an optimized navigation structure, presents different size images or carries out other adaptations to suit the particular delivery context.</p><p>There are several methods by which a content provider can discover information about the delivery context, such as  CC/PP, UAPROF, CSS Media Queries and various outputs of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/di/">Device Independence Working Group</a>. The companion Techniques <a href="#Techniques">[Techniques]</a> document describes these methods.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="d0e451" id="d0e451"/>3.6 Choice of User Experience</h3><p>In the interests of "One Web" (see <a href="#OneWeb">3.1 One Web</a>) considerations, the content provider may choose to allow the user to select from broad categories such as mobile or desktop presentation, where these are distinguished in the application. If the presentation option has been determined automatically, the content provider may choose to allow the user to override the automatic determination. Where a choice of presentations is available, it is good practice to record the user's preferences and to allow them to be changed.</p><p>Given an appropriate server environment, it is unlikely that the content provider will be unable to find out anything about the delivery context. However this can happen, either because details of the delivery context are not available in sufficient detail or because the server does not provide the ability to inspect and act on the information provided. In this case a "reasonable default experience" should be provided.</p><p>The details of the default experience depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the geographic region in which the service is offered and the primary intention of the service (e.g. considering whether the service is primarily desktop focused vs. primarily mobile focused).</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="ddc" id="ddc"/>3.7 Default Delivery Context</h3><p>In order to allow content providers to share a consistent view of a default mobile experience the BPWG has defined the Default Delivery Context. This allows providers to create appropriate experiences in the absence of adaptation and provides a baseline experience where adaptation is used. The Default Delivery Context has been determined by the BPWG as being the minimum delivery context specification necessary for a reasonable experience of the Web. It is recognized that devices that do not meet this specification can provide a reasonable experience of other non-Web services.</p><p>It is also recognized that this specification is made against the background of demographic, cultural and economic assumptions. Content providers may choose to provide services that demand a different or lower delivery context specification, but should try to provide an experience that exploits the capabilities of the Default Delivery Context in order to provide the best possible experience for that context.</p><p>It is stressed that many devices exceed the capabilities defined by the DDC. Content providers are encouraged not to diminish the user experience on those devices by developing only to the DDC specification, and are encouraged to adapt their content, where appropriate, to exploit the capabilities of the actual device.</p><p>In summary, the purpose of defining the DDC is to support the following rules:</p><ul><li><p>If an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-adaptation">adaptation process</a> is used, then information that is known about the actual Delivery Context should (see <a href="#lcd">5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities</a>) be used to vary the delivered content to make it more suitable for that specific Delivery Context or to provide an enhanced user experience.</p></li><li><p>If the delivered content does not result from an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-adaptation">adaptation process</a> - e.g. the content is statically defined as HTML stored in files, or the details of the Delivery Context cannot adequately be determined, then the delivered content should be suitable for the Default Delivery Context and should comply with the Best Practice statements.</p></li></ul><p>The Default Delivery Context is defined as follows:</p><dl><dt class="label">Usable Screen Width</dt><dd><p>120 pixels, minimum.</p></dd><dt class="label">Markup Language Support</dt><dd><p>XHTML Basic 1.1 <a href="#XHTML-Basic">[XHTML-Basic]</a> delivered with content type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p></dd><dt class="label">Character Encoding</dt><dd><p>UTF-8 <a href="#UTF-8">[UTF-8]</a>.</p></dd><dt class="label">Image Format Support</dt><dd><p>JPEG.</p><p>GIF 89a.</p></dd><dt class="label">Maximum Total Page Weight</dt><dd><p>20 kilobytes.</p></dd><dt class="label">Colors</dt><dd><p>256 Colors, minimum.</p></dd><dt class="label">Style Sheet Support</dt><dd><p>CSS Level 1 <a href="#CSS">[CSS]</a>.

			<div class="div2">
<h3><a name="bpgroupgeneral" id="bpgroupgeneral"/>5.1 Overall Behavior</h3><p>There are some general principles that underlie delivery to mobile devices. </p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="tc" id="tc"/>5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI</h4><p id="THEMATIC_CONSISTENCY" class="stmt">[THEMATIC_CONSISTENCY] Ensure that content provided by accessing a URI yields a thematically coherent experience when accessed from different devices. </p><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e672" id="d0e672"/>5.1.1.1 What it means</h5><p> This is a realization of the One Web (see <a href="#OneWeb">3.1 One Web</a>) principle, whereby content should be accessible on a range of devices irrespective of differences in presentation capabilities and access mechanism. Web sites may paginate their content in various ways corresponding to differences in device characteristics; therefore the navigation structure of the site, and possibly its technical realization, may vary according to the device class that is being served. (See also <a href="#WebArch">[WebArch]</a>
							<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence">Section 3.5.1</a>).</p><p>A bookmark captured on one device should be usable on another, different type of device even if it does not yield exactly the same experience. If the page that was bookmarked is not appropriate for the device that is now using it,  an alternative that is suitable should be provided. </p><p>URIs may be decorated to provide session or other information. If a URI is decorated with session information that is no longer current, then
the user should be directed to a point in the navigation hierarchy that is
appropriate to their device, in order to establish appropriate session and other
parameters.</p></div></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="lcd" id="lcd"/>5.1.2 Exploit <span>Device</span> Capabilities</h4><p id="CAPABILITIES" class="stmt">[CAPABILITIES] Exploit device capabilities to provide an enhanced user experience.</p><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e696" id="d0e696"/>5.1.2.1 What it means</h5><p>While encouraging content providers to be sensitive to the needs of the Default Delivery Context, it is not intended that this will result in a diminished experience on more capable devices. <span>Develop sites that target the
Default Delivery Context. In addition, where appropriate, use device
capabilities to provide a better user experience</span> on more capable devices.</p></div></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="d0e704" id="d0e704"/>5.1.3 Work around Deficient Implementations</h4><p id="DEFICIENCIES" class="stmt">[DEFICIENCIES] Take reasonable steps to work around deficient implementations.</p><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e709" id="d0e709"/>5.1.3.1 What it means</h5><p>Just as in the desktop world, there are browsers that do not respect the intentions of the content provider. There are differences in interpretation between browsers and there are also deficiencies in implementation. By deficient we mean non-support of mandatory features of a relevant standard or recommendation and other bugs or errors in implementation. </p><p>Because the software in mobile devices is frequently embedded in the device, there is no easy way to correct or enhance it once it is in the field. It is a particular challenge to provide work-arounds for these deficiencies and differences in interpretation. It is recognized that content providers may need to violate specific Best Practices in order to support their intentions on devices that exhibit deficiencies in implementation. If a device is not known to have specific limitations then content providers must comply with Best Practices.
</p><p>Just as it is not the intention to recommend a least common denominator approach, neither is it the intention to recommend avoiding features that exhibit problems on some class of devices.</p><p>It is also not the intention to suggest that content providers should restrict their support to certain device types. Content providers should aim to support as wide a range of device types as is practical.</p></div></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="test" id="test"/>5.1.4 Testing</h4><p id="TESTING" class="stmt">[TESTING] Carry out testing on actual devices as well as emulators.  </p><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e725" id="d0e725"/>5.1.4.1 What it means</h5><p>Any Web site should be tested in a range of browsers. Mobile browsers often show markedly different characteristics to desktop browsers. As well as assessing a site's suitability for display in reduced format, content providers are encouraged to test that the features they rely on work in actual devices. </p><p>Content providers should also test with specific features disabled, such as using text-only modes and with scripting disabled.</p></div><div class="div4">

of links on a page should not be minimized at the expense of adding page
retrievals. </p><p>Design the service so that frequently accessed information is
easily reached with a minimum number of page retrievals. Navigation to less
frequently accessed information may take more retrievals as a result. A guideline is that users become frustrated if it takes more than four retrievals to reach their objective.
Whether this can be achieved depends on the nature of the site and, in particular, how items in menus group together to provide understandable
themes.</p></div></div><div class="div3">

<h4><a name="d0e1875" id="d0e1875"/>5.4.13 Error Messages</h4><p id="ERROR_MESSAGES" class="stmt">[ERROR_MESSAGES] 
Provide informative error messages and a means of navigating away from an error message back to useful information. </p><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e1880" id="d0e1880"/>5.4.13.1 What it means</h5><p>
It is inevitable that, on occasions, a mobile user will not be successful in
accessing the content or information they sought. Providing easy navigation
away from the error is particularly important in the mobile arena, where
browsers may not have an easy-to-find "back" button, where contextualization
is frequently difficult and where re-entry of URIs as a means of error
recovery is particularly difficult.</p><p>
It is noted that errors due to networking, connection and some kinds of
mistyping of URIs are not within the control of the content provider, which has
no way to influence how such errors are presented to the user. However,
where errors are within the control of the content provider the user should be
provided with clear information regarding the fault they have experienced.
This should help them to understand whether the fault was temporary or
permanent, whether they should retry the attempt to access the content and how
they may be able to escalate the problem.
</p><p>
It should also be possible for the user to escape from the error condition. They should either be able to return to the page they were on prior to the error, or to be able to move onwards to a convenient part of the service from where they can retry or alter the transaction they were attempting.
</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e1889" id="d0e1889"/>5.4.13.2 How to do it</h5><p>
It is noted that many Web servers provide a default error page, especially in
the event of a request for a non-existent page (404) or an internal error
(500). Where possible (see <a href="#TOMCAT">[TOMCAT]</a>, <a href="#APACHE">[APACHE]</a> and <a href="#IIS">[IIS]</a>), applications should trap all
error conditions by overriding the default pages if necessary, and handle
them in a user-friendly, and graceful, way. 
</p><p>
Error messages should be provided in the same language as the application that was being used. They should be clear and concise, adhering to the same Best Practices as the rest of the application. They should be provided in a format that the device can handle.
</p><p>
The error message should detail whether the issue is likely to be temporary or permanent, whether the user may be able to solve the issue themselves (for example, by changing input data or a handset setting), or whether it is an issue that can be escalated to the content provider or network operator. In the latter case, contact details, such as an SMS address or a support line number, might be appropriate.
</p><p>
The error message should provide one or more of the following navigational constructs:</p><ol class="enumar"><li><p>A "back" link to return to the previous page (particularly for devices
that do not have an easy to find back button);
</p></li><li><p>A "retry" link to attempt the relevant part of the transaction again (note that this may not be equivalent to a page "refresh");</p></li><li><p>A "home" link to allow the user to return to the main part of the application.
</p></li></ol><p>
The error message can provide an error code to be used for diagnosis of the issue. However, the use of an error code is not a substitute for a human-readable message. While some users may understand "404" to mean "page cannot be found", this must not be assumed to be true for all users.

<h5><a name="d0e1930" id="d0e1930"/>5.4.14.1 What it means</h5><p>Cookies are frequently used to carry out session management, to identify users and to store user preferences. Many mobile devices do not implement cookies or offer only an incomplete implementation. In addition, some gateways strip cookies and others simulate cookies on behalf of mobile devices. </p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e1935" id="d0e1935"/>5.4.14.2 How to do it</h5><p>Test that cookies are supported by the device on its current access path.

<h5><a name="d0e1950" id="d0e1950"/>5.4.15.1 What it means</h5><p>Limited bandwidth and high latency can reduce the usability of Web sites on mobile devices. Using caching information effectively can reduce the need to
reload data such as style sheets, images and pages, thus improving performance and reducing cost of use. It can also prevent the reuse of content where this is not appropriate, for example content that is adapted for one device should not be re-used by different devices. <span>Devices</span> and network caches are both affected by caching information.</p></div><div class="div4">
<h5><a name="d0e1958" id="d0e1958"/>5.4.15.2 How to do it</h5><p>Set expiry times in a way that is appropriate to your application.
