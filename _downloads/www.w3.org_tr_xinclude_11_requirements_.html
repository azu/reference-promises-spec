<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This document summarizes requirements and use cases for possible
enhancements to XInclude.</p>
</div>
<div class="status">
<h2>Status of this Document</h2>
<p>Implementation experience has led users of XInclude to suggest a
number of enhancements. These enhancements would allow XInclude to
support the needs of richer applications by providing mechanisms to
address uniqueness constraints, to communicate with processes that
occur after XInclude, and to take advantage of the fragment
identifier scheme for <tt class="code">text/plain</tt> documents.
This document attempts to enumerate these enhancements.</p>

<h3><a name="introduction" id=
"introduction"></a>1&#160;Introduction</h3>
<p>It has been several years since the XInclude Recommendation was
published. This document outlines the requirements and use cases
for to changes to XInclude: support for [<a href=
"#rfc-5147"><span class="abbrev">RFC 5147</span></a>] and improved
communication between the pre- and post-inclusion Infosets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="rfc5147" id="rfc5147"></a>2&#160;Support for RFC
5147</h3>
<p>XInclude offers facilities for both XML inclusion and plain text
inclusion. In its current design, the use of fragment identifiers
(in the <tt class="tag-attribute">xpointer</tt> attribute) is
forbidden when performing plain text inclusion.</p>
<p>The publication of RFC 5147 introduces a fragment identifier
syntax for text/plain content. It would be very useful to be able
to extract portions of a text document with RFC 5147 fragment
identifiers just as it is useful to be able to extract portions of
an XML document with XPointer.</p>
<p>XInclude should be extended to support RFC 5147 fragment
identifiers when <tt class="code">parse="text"</tt> is
specified.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="text-pointer-design" id=
"text-pointer-design"></a>2.1&#160;Text pointer design</h4>
<p>It's worth considering, briefly, the possible design choices
that could be made in adding support for RFC 5147. Three seem
apparent:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Support a new fragment identifier scheme in the <tt class=
"tag-attribute">xpointer</tt> attribute, for example <tt class=
"code">xpointer="text(line=12,19;length=1859)"</tt>. Unfortunately,
the <tt class="tag-attribute">xpointer</tt> attribute is described
as being specifically for XPointer fragment identifiers. XPointer,
in turn, is specifically about XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a new attribute, for example <tt class=
"tag-attribute">textpointer</tt> to hold the fragment identifier
for text/plain content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a new attribute, for example <tt class=
"tag-attribute">fragid</tt> to hold the fragment identifier and
deprecate the use of <tt class="tag-attribute">xpointer</tt>. In
some respects, this seems the most logical choice, but it would
invalidate (or at least deprecate) all existing documents that are
using fragment identifiers. What's more, implementors would have to
support both attributes indefinitely in order to handle legacy
content, so this doesn't seem to provide much benefit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Adding a new attribute seems like the best compromise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="improved-communication" id=
"improved-communication"></a>3&#160;Improved communication between
the pre- and post-included infosets</h3>
<p>XInclude is a transformative process. It begins with two or more
infosets and produces a new, single infoset that represents the
result of the transformation process. (For the purpose of this
discussion, it's sufficient to consider the case where <tt class=
"code">parse="text"</tt> is specified as including an infoset that
consists entirely of character information items).</p>
<p>There are aspects of the included infosets that must be made
manifest in the resulting infoset in order to preserve semantics.
Specifically, a <tt class="tag-attribute">xml:base</tt> attribute
may be added to included elements in order to preserve the XML Base
of the included items and a <tt class="tag-attribute">xml:lang</tt>
attribute may be added to included elements in order to preserve
the language of the included items.</p>
<p>These additional bits of communication across the transclusion
boundary preserve important semantic information present in the
original infosets. It is possible to imagine <em>other</em> kinds
of important semantic information that an author might want to
preserve.</p>
<p>In particular, one troubling aspect of XInclude processing is
the potential damage done to ID/IDREF relationships. If the same ID
is defined in several included documents (each of which is entirely
valid on its own), the resulting document cannot be valid because
it contains duplicate ID values. By the same token, IDREF values
that ostensibly point to one of these now duplicated IDs are now
left in an unfortunate state.</p>
<p>Authors might have several strategies in mind for resolving
these problems:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Perform textual transformation of IDs in (some) included
documents to force uniqueness across the entire resulting
infoset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform IDREF fixup using any of several algorithms:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
<li>
<p>Within an included fragment, point to the locally included
ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within an included fragment, point to globally the first ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outside an included fragment, point to the first preceding
ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outside an included fragment, point to the first following
ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Point to the closest ID.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>It's clear that there is no single strategy that would satisfy
all authors all the time. In fact, on examination, it becomes clear
that there's no single strategy that would satisfy all authors
<em>within the same document</em>. (For additional background and
detailed analysis of one real use case, see [<a href=
"#dbtrans-req"><span class="abbrev">DBTRANS-REQ</span></a>] and
[<a href="#dbtrans"><span class="abbrev">DBTRANS</span></a>].)</p>
<p>Designing a language (or extending XInclude) to support this
degree of flexibility would be complicated. This complexity would
be exacerbated by the fact that generic XML tools may not even be
able to identify all of the ID and IDREF values in a document.
Addressing this problem may require vocabulary-specific knowledge
of the documents involved.</p>
<p>Attempts to solve the problem in a vocabulary-specific manner,
however, run afoul of the fact that XInclude leaves no trace of its
actions. A processor cannot come back to the result of an XInclude
transformation and identify the boundaries of inclusion.</p>
<p>The ability to do that, which is arguably semantic information
at least as valuable as the base URI and language of the included
documents, would provide the hooks necessary to develop
application-specific solutions without requiring that those
solutions encompass <em>all</em> of the features of XInclude.</p>
<p>One method of providing this information would be to pass
attributes present on the <tt class="tag-element">xi:include</tt>
element through to the root element(s) included. For example, if a
<tt class="code">chapter</tt> was included with this XInclude:</p>
<div class="programlisting">
<pre>
&lt;xi:include href="chapter.xml" ex:root="true" ex:fixup="nearest"/&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>The resulting infoset might include the chapter in this way:</p>
<div class="programlisting">
<pre>
&lt;chapter xml:base="base/chapter.xml" xml:lang="en-us"
         ex:root="true" ex:fixup="nearest"/&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Passing additional attributes through would provide a mechanism
for authors to communicate with down-stream processes.</p>
<p>XInclude should be extended to support improved communication
between the pre- and post-included infosets.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="communication-design" id=
"communication-design"></a>3.1&#160;Communication design</h4>
<p>It's worth considering, briefly, the possible design choices
that could be made in adding support of this kind:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>All attributes could be copied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All attributes except <tt class="tag-attribute">href</tt>,
<tt class="tag-attribute">parse</tt>, <tt class=
"tag-attribute">xml:base</tt>, and <tt class=
"tag-attribute">xml:lang</tt> could be copied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only namespace-qualified attributes could be copied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only <em>non-</em>namespace-qualified attributes could be
copied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attributes to be copied could be explicitly enumerated in
another new attribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some record of which attributes <em>have been</em> copied could
be added to the result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>There are merits to each of these options, and there may be
others, but ideally the solution will be as simple as possible.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that none of these approaches offers any
solution for inclusions that consist of top-level nodes other than
elements. It doesn't appear possible to address those cases.</p>
