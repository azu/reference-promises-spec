  <h2 id="intro">1 
    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Because of its scalable, geometric nature, SVG is inherently  suited to both print
    and screen output. The same colors can be output, using an ICC-based color managed
    workflow on the printer and an sRGB fallback approximation on screen. This has been
    true since SVG 1.0, and so SVG has been used in print workflows (for example, in
    combination with XSL FO) as well as on screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is common in cross-media publishing to design content which will be used both
    online and in print media. This specification gives guidance on how to create such
    content and how to indicate that it has been adapted to improve its color capability.</p>


  <h2 id="colorspec">2 
    Color specification
  </h2>
  <p>
    SVG Color allows color to be specified in a number of ways. All of the sRGB color
    syntaxes from SVG Print 1.2 are supported. The ICC-based color syntax from SVG 1.1
    Full is also supported, and unlike SVG 1.1 rendering this feature is not optional. New to the SVG Color specification, <a href="#named">ICC named
      colors</a> and <a href="#devcolor">device colors</a> are supported as well: their
    syntax is defined below.</p>
  <h3 id="sRGBcolor">2.1 
    sRGB colors</h3>
  <p>
    As with SVG Tiny 1.2, colors may be specified in the sRGB colorspace without providing
    a color profile. This color space, which uuses the chromaticities of a standard
    TV broadcast monitor and viewing conditions typical of an office environment, has
    a reduced gamut suitable for minimising banding on 'real world' colors at the expense
    of being unable to directly represent highly saturated colors. A number of equivalent
    syntactic forms are supported, as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/painting.html#colorSyntax">
      defined in SVG Tiny 1.2</a>:</p>
  <pre class="example">
  &lt;circle cx="200" cy="135" r="20" fill="#3b3"/&gt;
  &lt;circle cx="240" cy="135" r="20" fill="#33bb33"/&gt;
  &lt;circle cx="200" cy="175" r="20" fill="rgb(51,187,51)"/&gt;
  &lt;circle cx="240" cy="175" r="20" fill="rgb(20%,73.333%,20%)"/&gt;
</pre>
  <h3 id="iccoutput">2.2 
    ICC colors</h3>
  <p>
    Since SVG 1.0, SVG has contained functionality for use of ICC color profiles which
    define colors in a different color space than sRGB. This functionality has been
    available since SVG 1.0 but for the most part has not been well understood. SVP
    Print tightens the conformance criteria for using ICC colors.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, it is possible to specify all objects in terms of an ICC color space
    such as SWOP CMYK and the SVG renderer perform all rendering of the objects entirely
    in the SWOP CMYK space followed by color correction for a printer target CMYK. This
    render workflow would never require conversion into and out of sRGB. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case where opacity is used and objects overlap a render device must use the
    supplied sRGB fallback color in order to composite objects together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The implication of this is that it is possible to use a fully colormanaged workflow (using
    SVG 1.0 onwards) that supports a full CMYK pipeline via the use of ICC profiles.
    Such an SVG render device must also be capable of handling a switch into the fallback
    render color space (sRGB) for the overlapping portions of objects with transparency.
  </p>
  <p>
    An implementation may determine the areas of an object to render in object's ICC
    color and those areas to render in its sRGB fallback by doing object intersection
    calculations as a pre-render step. An implementation could alternatviely decide
    render color choice on a pixel by pixel basis during rasterisation. Such behaviour
    is implementation specific and can lead to varying rendering results from different
    implementations at the borders of overlapping areas when using ICC colors.
  </p>
  <h3 id="named">2.3 
    Named color</h3>
  <p>
    SVG Color introduces the ability to use so-called 'named' or 'spot' colors. Named
    colors are used in many print applications and are supported in SVG Print through
    the use of ICC named color profiles. For color managed displays, the desired color may be accurately simulated. Non color managed user agents will use the sRGB fallback value.
  </p>
  <h4 id="iccnamed">2.3.1 
    Use of the ICC named color syntax
  </h4>
  <p>
    The paint specifiers for fill and stroke include the <span class="property">icc-named-color</span>
    keyword. This may be used to look up colors by their name. For example in graphic
    arts workflows it is common to use Pantone®
    
    color names for specifying paint on objects. The <span class="property">icc-named-color</span>
    keyword may be used for such workflows.
  </p>
  <h4 id="iccnamedmanage">2.3.2 
    ICC named color profile management
  </h4>
  <p>
    An SVG 1.2 file may specify ICC named color profiles via use of the <span class="element">
      color-profile</span> element.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ICC specification indicates that named color profiles must contain a PCS (Profile
    Connection Space) representation and can optionally contain a device representation
    for each named color. An implementation may support device representations of ICC
    named colors, however that support is device specific and should be managed outside
    of the SVG file itself by use of some form of job ticket information.
  </p>

  
  <h3 id="labcolor">2.4 
    CIE LAB color specification
  </h3>
  <p>SVG Color allows any visible color to be directly specified in the standard, 
    device-independent CIE L*ab color space. Both the cartestian (L*ab) 
    and polar (L*CHab) forms are supported. The latter has the advantage that 
    chroma and hue are more intuitive to specify than the abstract a and b axes.</p>
  
  <h3 id="devcolor">2.4 
    Device color specification
  </h3>
  <p>
    Occasionally, it is necessary to specify non-colormanaged colors in terms of the 
    eventual device colorants. An example  would be the creation of registration marks, 
    or  tint bars of pure ink for quality control purposes.
