<H2>Abstract</H2>
<P>Domain models play a central role throughout the software development cycle, 
from requirements analysis to design, through implementation and beyond. As 
such, great progress has been made in the consistent use of models throughout 
this process. Modern software development tools with support for the UML and 
code generation as well as Model-Driven Architectures allow for developers to 
synchronize and verify technical implementation with user requirements using 
models. However, the reusability of domain models is often limited because they 
are, by definition, domain specific and only take into consideration 
abstractions needed to make possible a solution within the confines of their own 
individual problem space. But the Web is broader than that and provides a 
multidimensional solution space capable of referencing an almost limitless set 
of domains. While much of our software becomes increasingly embedded in the Web, 
our development processes do not fully exploit the potential of model reuse from 
the Web yet. This note therefore introduces Semantic Web languages such as RDF 
Schema and OWL, and shows how they can be used in tandem with mainstream 
object-oriented languages. We show that the Semantic Web can serve as a platform 
on which domain models can be created, shared and reused.</P>

<H2><A name=introduction></A>1 Introduction</H2>
<P>It is common for software systems to be centered on domain models to 
represent aspects of their target problem space. Domain models can describe the 
relevant concepts and data structures from an application domain and encode 
knowledge that is useful to drive an application's behavior. For example, assume 
that our task is to develop an online shopping system. During requirements 
analysis for this system, we might learn that:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>
  <OL>
    <LI>Purchase orders associate a customer with a list of products 
    <LI>Customers have a home country 
    <LI>Germany, France and Australia are countries 
    <LI>Germany and France are part of the European Union 
    <LI>The European Union is a free-trade zone 
    <LI>Orders from customers who live in a country that has a free-trade 
    agreement with the online shops' country are duty free </LI></OL></UL>
<P>After some thinking we may come up with an object-oriented design such as the 
following UML class diagram.</P>
<P align=center><IMG height=166 src="uml-diagram.png"
alt="simple domain model in UML"
width=552></P>
<P align=center>Figure1: A simple domain model in UML syntax.</P>
<P>We can present this schematic to our customer for discussion and after a few 
iterations we may end up with a data structure that can be implemented in our 
favoured programming language. We may also begin with user interface components 
for end-users (maybe JavaServer Pages) and for the online shop managers (who may 
require a more sophisticated front-end implemented in Java/Swing, C# or Visual 
Basic, for example). If our system proves successful, more components can be 
built around it, for example to access the product catalogue through a Web 
Service. In these cases, other components would want to share the same data 
structures and domain knowledge so that they can interoperate. Even if our 
system is not so successful or the system it ported to a different platform, we 
may at least want to reuse parts of it. In these cases, it would be useful to 
have access to the underlying domain model so that we can extract the parts that 
we need.</P>
<P>Since we anticipate all these potential developments, we design our system 
with a <EM>Model-View-Control</EM> architecture <A 
href="#ref-BMRSS-1996">[BMRSS 
1996]</A>. This well-known pattern suggests the separation of domain models from 
user interface and control logic. The separation of non-visual parts from visual 
components makes it potentially easier to reuse and share domain models for 
other applications and target platforms. Unfortunately, however, the promise of 
reusability of object-oriented models is often not fulfilled. In many cases, 
domain models like the above contain hard-coded dependencies with the specific 
application. Especially once the model is encoded in a programming language, 
much of the knowledge that went into the initial design is lost. For example, 
the condition as to whether a purchase order is duty free may be encoded by 
if-statements deep in some imperative method (such as
<CODE>totalPrice()</CODE>; in the UML diagram), and 
the fact that each
<CODE>PurchaseOrder</CODE> requires at least 
one product will also not be clear unless you care to read through the control 
logic of the user interface implementation. Another typical problem with such 
systems is interoperability. For example, if some other application wants to 
interface data or services from our system, it would need to go through a 
well-defined interface (API) that is strictly coupled with our application. 
Maybe an intermediate format based on XML is used to exchange information among 
such applications. If multiple applications with similar tasks shall 
interoperate, a large number of such interfaces and exchange formats will be 
needed.</P>
<P>The UML diagram offers the greatest potential for reuse and interoperability 
in our example scenario. Such diagrams model at a higher level of abstraction 
and can be used to derive implementation code for multiple purposes. However, 
even if two components or applications have started with the same UML diagram, 
they may have incompatible implementations. Still a lot of hand-crafted code 
will be required to implement them. In which format shall customer data be 
stored and shared? The UML model may be ambiguous and misunderstood. In one 
implementation, countries may be stored as string values, while others may want 
to represent them as instances of a Country class. In either case, it is unclear 
where and how the specific countries such as Germany and France shall be 
represented in UML. Furthermore, unless a project follows a consistent 
model-driven approach, UML diagrams are often only maintained as intermediate 
artifacts in the development life cycle, used as the foundation for the 
implementation but then filed away where they are inaccessible to other 
developers. UML models are often hidden for a good reason, because they may no 
longer be up to date with the realimplementation. The result of this software 
development reality is that much time is wasted with unnecessary duplicate work. 
Domain models need to be crafted from the scratch at the start, and then mapped 
into intermediate formats to share data among applications.</P>
<P>In an ideal world, developers would discover shareable domain models and 
knowledge bases from a variety of interrelated repositories and then wire them 
together with the remaining object-oriented components for user interface and 
control components - a concept slowly becoming recognised as <EM>Ontology Driven 
Architecture</EM>. All applications that share overlapping domain models would 
then have a certain degree of interoperability built in. While this ideal world 
is still mostly a vision, some promising approaches are begining to appear <A 
href="#ref-TPOWUK-2005">[TPOWUK 
2005]</A>.</P>
<P>Rather unnoticed from the main software engineering camps, the World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C) has designed some very interesting technology in the context of 
its <EM>Semantic Web</EM> vision (cf. the W3C's <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web Activity</A>). This technology, 
including RDF <A 
href="#ref-RDF-2004">[RDF 
2004]</A> and OWL <A 
href="#ref-OWL-2004">[OWL 
2004]</A>, has been originally designed with the goal of making web pages easier 
to understand for intelligent agents and web services. Interestingly, however, 
it turns out that Semantic Web languages and tools could also play a major role 
in software development in general.</P>
<P>The Semantic Web community has produced a set of complimentary languages and 
tools for developing, maintaining, using and sharing domain models for Software 
Engineering, amongst other purposes. At the core are the languages OWL and RDF 
Schema, OWL being optimized to represent structural knowledge at a high level of 
abstraction. Domain models encoded in OWL can be uploaded on the Web and shared 
among multiple applications. OWL is supported by an unambiguous dialect of 
formal logic called <EM>Description Logics</EM> <A 
href="#ref-BHS-2003">[BHS 
2003]</A>. This formal underpinning makes it possible to exploit intelligent 
reasoning services such as automatic classification and consistency checking. 
These services can be used at build-time and therefore facilitate the 
construction of reusable, well-tested domain models. Reasoning services can also 
be used at runtime for various purposes. For example, this makes it possible to 
define classes dynamically, to re-classify instances at runtime and to perform 
complex logical queries. In addition to their foundation on logics, OWL and RDF 
Schema operate on similar structures to object-oriented languages, and therefore 
can be effectively integrated with traditional software components.</P>
<P>To summarize, the key benefits of RDF Schema and OWL compared to 
object-oriented languages are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Reuse and interoperability</STRONG>: RDF and OWL models can be 
  shared among applications and on the web 
  <LI><STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG>: RDF and OWL models can operate in an open 
  environment in which classes can be defined dynamically etc 
  <LI><STRONG>Consistency and Quality Checking</STRONG> across models 
  <LI><STRONG>Reasoning</STRONG>: OWL has rich expressivity supported by 
  automated reasoning tools </LI></UL>
<P>Note that some of these benefits, such as consistency checking and automated 
reasoning, can also be achieved by means of the Object Constraint Language 
(OCL). OCL is part of the OMG's family of languages for Model-Driven 
Architecture, and provides similar expressivity to modern Semantic Web 
languages. For example the constraint from Figure 1 could have been expressed in 
OCL to formalize the conditions of duty-free orders. However, OCL has not been 
designed for the Web, but is optimized to represent constraints within rather 
closed data models. Semantic Web technology has been designed for an open world, 
in which models are shared among multiple applications and groups. We will show 
later how this openness manifests itself in the Semantic Web languages. It is 
worth noting though that the differences between object-oriented languages and 
OWL are not impossible to bridge. In fact, an OMG working group is defining an 
Ontology Definition Metamodel <A 
href="#ref-ODM-2005">[ODM 
2005]</A> that will allow developers to use Semantic Web languages in tandem 
with other formats such as OCL.</P>
<P>This document now goes on to explain how object-oriented applications can be 
designed and implemented with the help of Semantic Web technologies. Section 2 
gives an outline of how the application development life cycle can benefit from 
Semantic Web approaches. Section 3 introduces the Semantic Web languages RDF 
Schema and OWL, and compares them to object-oriented modeling languages. Section 
4 shows how RDF and OWL models can be embedded into object-oriented programs 
(here, using Java). The Appendix provides references to further reading, tools 
and libraries.</P>
<H2><A name=development></A>2 Application Development with Semantic 
WebTechnology</H2>
<P>What is the Semantic Web? Most of the current "traditional" web content is 
geared for human use. Presentation languages such as HTML contain instructions 
for Web browsers advising how to present multi-media specifically for our visual 
and auditory perception. However, if we wanted to employ a computer program to 
search for Web-based information for us, then such methods would find it very 
difficult to make any sense of these Web pages, unless they had advanced human 
language skills. Furthermore, contemporary server-side Web languages like JSP or 
ASP support a random mixture of model and view parts in a single file, leading 
to very unstructured content.</P>
<P>The vision behind the Semantic Web is to make web content machine-readable so 
that it can be more easily analyzed by software agents and shared among Web 
Services. For that purpose, the <EM>World Wide Web Consortium</EM> (W3C) is 
recommending a number of Web-based languages that can be used to formalize web 
content. RDF Schema and OWL can be used to describe classes, attributes and 
relationships similar to object-oriented languages. For example, RDF Schema can 
be used to define that the class
<CODE>Product</CODE> has a property
<CODE>hasPrice</CODE> which takes values of type 
float. And you can define a class
<CODE>Purchase</CODE> with a property
<CODE>hasProducts</CODE> which relates it with 
multiple <CODE>Product</CODE>s. OWL extends 
RDF Schema by additional constructs to define more complex classes. For example, 
OWL can be used to define a class
<CODE>DutyFreeOrder</CODE> as the subclass of 
all purchases that have a delivery address to a country that is known to have a 
free-trade agreement. The W3C also works on other languages for describing 
if-then rules and complex SQL-like queries, but our focus lies on RDF Schema and 
OWL in this discussion.</P>
<P>Domain models in any of these languages can be uploaded and linked into the 
Web just like you would publish an HTML page. Once an RDF or OWL file is online, 
other Web resources or applications can link to it. For example, a HTML page 
showing a specific product could encode metadata to link back to the 
corresponding entity in an OWL model so that all applications that understand 
what a "product" is can make sense out of the HTML page. Or, providers of 
specific products can instantiate the RDF Schema classes to announce their 
portfolio to shopping agents in an unambiguous exchange format. A typical 
scenario for such a Semantic Web application is shown in Figure 2.</P>
<P align=center><IMG height=398 src="architecture.png" 
alt="exploiting domain models and services from the Web"
width=542></P>
<P align=center>Figure 2: An application using Semantic Web technology can 
exploit domain models and services from the Web. The yellow boxes represent OWL 
files in a UML-like graphical notation. Note that UML notation is merely used as 
an example - other visualizations may be more appropriate to capture the full 
semantics of OWL.</P>
<P>While a certain level of interoperability could also be achieved using 
traditional XML-based approaches, Semantic Web languages have richer 
expressivity. Similar to object-oriented languages, RDF Schema and OWL make it 
possible to define subclasses and generalizations of concepts. The organization 
of a domain model into classes suggests natural mappings to integrate models 
into the remaining software components. Furthermore, since every Semantic Web 
resource has a unique URI, it is possible to establish links among existing 
models. This means that whenever a model of a specific domain has been published 
on the Web, then others are potentially able to build upon it, and thus 
establish a network of domain, and possibly cross-domain, knowledge.</P>
<P>The extensibility of Semantic Web languages supports reusability on a global 
scale. Instead of defining the 1000th variation of a product-purchase domain 
model, application developers may be able to locate a suitable model on the Web 
and simply reuse or extend it. By reusing an existing model, different 
applications with similar tasks can share results and data much more easily. 
Furthermore, it is likely that an application-independent reusable component 
(such as a shopping basket application or a credit card handling Web Service) 
can be integrated. While the promise of global knowledge sharing on the Semantic 
Web is possibly a bit overambitious in the immediate future, RDF Schema and OWL 
provide at least the infrastructure to build reusable structures among 
communities of interest. It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss these 
issues in detail.</P>
<P>The promise of reusability is partly due to the fact that Semantic 
Weblanguages are Web-based: each class, property or object in an RDF Schema or 
OWL file has a unique identifier (URI), so that it can be referenced from 
anywhere else. The other major strength that makes Semantic Web models highly 
reusable is that OWL is founded on formal logic. This means that OWL models are 
not only limited to defining classes and their attributes, but can also restrict 
the potential instantiations of these classes, so that the classes can be 
unambiguously shared among groups of humans or machines. Domain models that are 
based on such well-defined logics are often referred to as <EM>ontologies</EM>. 
In fact, the abbreviation OWL stands for the "Web Ontology Language". According 
to <A 
href="#ref-OWL-2004">[OWL 
2004]</A>, OWL can be used to explicitly represent the meaning of terms in 
vocabularies and the relationships between those terms. This representation of 
terms and their interrelationships is again a form of ontology. From an 
object-oriented point of view, ontologies are domain classes that contain 
logical statements that make their meaning explicit. We will show later that 
tools called reasoners can exploit these logical statements to perform advanced 
queries which reveal implicit relationships among resources. </P>
<P>Ontologies and domain models often span different levels of abstraction, 
application-dependency and reusability. Revisiting the example from the 
introduction, statements 1 and 2 specify data structures that represent customer 
and purchase data. Statements 3, 4, and 5 are about specific countries, which 
could be used for geographical or political applications. Statement 6 is 
independent from these specific countries and describes general domain 
relationships for countries that fulfill certain criteria. These parts should be 
made reusable or be reused from standardized solutions. In fact, ontologies are 
often defined by groups of humans (such as an e-commerce consortium or a 
national geological survey) in order to interrelate a shared domain vocabulary 
for information integration.Once a standardized ontology of countries and their 
relationships exists, there is no need to reinvent this for each individual 
application. Furthermore, reusing existing ontologies from the Web has the 
advantage that an application would more directly benefit from updates such as 
new countries.</P>
<P>However, the specific customers and our online shop's localization to a 
specific country are application-specific and need to be custom-fitted. Such 
custom-fitting can be achieved by adding specific subclasses or instances. If 
shared ontologies/domain models are not optimized for a specific application 
purpose and thereforeneed to be adapted or built from the scratch, then domain 
modeling tools (such as those mentioned in the appendix) can be used. These 
tools are suitable for domain experts who have little or no training in 
programming languages. Comparable editors for the UML, these tools provide 
visual editors for classes and relationships, and allow users to create 
instances of these classes.</P>
<P>The domain modeling activities in such a development process can be compared 
to requirements analysis and design steps in traditional Software Engineering. 
The domain experts and eventual users join forces with software designers, 
developers and testers to come up with suitable abstractions of a domain. 
Ontologies from the Web are combined, extended and instantiated. Ontology 
development tools provide facilities to instantiate classes, so that example 
instances can be created and prototyped. The resulting domain models are then 
combined with the remaining application components such as user interface and 
control logic by programmers. In contrast to many traditional object-oriented 
design methodologies, where analysis and design only leads to intermediate 
artifacts for code generation, the Semantic Web approach uses the same models 
for all stages from analysis, design, implementation to testing and even at 
runtime. The ontologies defined in the early phases determine the classes in the 
implementation, and at the same time the original design models remain 
accessible when the application is executing. The formal logic behind ontologies 
can then even be exploited to derive test cases. If domain models have explicit 
runtime semantics, it is further possible to use reasoning services. We will 
look into this in more detail after we have introduced the basics of RDF and 
OWL.</P>
<H2><A name=languages></A>3 Introduction to RDF Schema and OWL</H2>
<P>In order to implement the Semantic Web vision, the W3C has produced a number 
of language specifications. RDF and its Schema constitute the base 
infrastructure to represent classes, properties and instances in a Web compliant 
format.OWL extends RDF Schema with richer expressivity. Both languages are now 
supported by tools, parsers and programming APIs. This section will introduce 
RDF Schema and OWL and compare them to object-oriented languages.</P>
<H3><A name=rdf></A>3.1 RDF and RDF Schema</H3>
<P><EM>RDF (Resource Description Framework)</EM> <A 
href="#ref-RDF-2004" 
>[RDF 2004]</A> is a Web-based language that can be used to describe 
associations among <EM>resources</EM> formally. A resource can be anything with 
a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Since they have URLs, HTML pages, images, 
and multi-media files are resources. In RDF, resources can also be classes, 
properties or instances. For example, the URI
<CODE>http://ecommerce.example.org/ecommerce.rdf#Product</CODE> 
could represent a class in an RDF file, and you could use this URI to annotate a 
Web page of a specific product.</P>
<P>RDF just defines the very basic syntax for Semantic Web content, and has an 
XML serialization that allows users to share models on the Web. <EM>RDF 
Schema</EM> defines an object-oriented model for RDF. RDF Schema defines how 
classes, subclass relationships, properties, datatypes etc. are represented. For 
example,the following RDF Schema file declares a class
<CODE>Product</CODE> and a property
<CODE>>hasPrice</CODE>:</P>

&lt;/rdf:RDF</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>It is far beyond the scope of this note to introduce the details of RDF, RDF 
Schema or the XML syntax. For the purpose of this document only a few concepts 
are important. URIs are often split into namespace and local name, and the 
namespace can be abbreviated with a prefix notation. For example,
<CODE>rdfs:Class</CODE> is the abbreviation of 
the URI
<CODE>http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class</CODE> 
if the prefix <CODE>rdfs</CODE> has been 
declared in the head of the file. If no prefix is given (such as in
<CODE>"Product"</CODE>), then the default 
namespace of the file is used. In order to simplify the presentation in this 
document, we will focus on this short notation based on the localnames.</P>
<P>Namespaces can be compared to <EM>packages</EM> in object-oriented languages. 
The file above can therefore be regarded to define the package
<CODE>http://ecommerce.example.org/ecommerce.rdf#</CODE>. 
All resources declared in a namespace are public, so that all RDF files could 
directly refer to each other. For example, you could create another RDF file 
that defines an instance of the
<CODE>Product</CODE> class above, and assign a 
specific price to the instance. Such instances are called <EM>individuals</EM> 
in RDF. In contrast to many object-oriented languages, individuals can be 
declared to have more than one direct type. For example, the individual
<CODE>http://myshop.example.com/products.rdf#Harry</CODE> 
could be declared to be both an instance of
<CODE>http://ecommerce.example.org/ecommerce.rdf#Product</CODE> 
and of
<CODE>http://auctioning.example.org/model.rdf#AuctionItem</CODE>. 
This would make it possible to use the same resource (denoted by its URI) in one 
context as a product and in another context as an auction item.</P>
<P>RDF Schema <EM>classes</EM> are sets of individuals with shared 
characteristics. Classes can be arranged in a subclass hierarchy very similar to 
object-oriented systems. Like the UML, RDF Schema supports multiple inheritance. 
A major difference between RDF and object-oriented languages, however, is that 
all classes can overlap. Since individuals can have multiple types, this means 
that some instances may be shared among classes. Furthermore, instances can 
change their type during their life cycle. A purchase order may start as a plain 
instance of the <CODE>PurchaseOrder</CODE> 
class, and later change its type to
<CODE>DutyFreeOrder</CODE> when the program 
has collected more information about the customer's delivery address.</P>
<P>Another important difference between Semantic Web and object-oriented 
languages is that the Semantic Web is an <EM>open world</EM>, in which files can 
add new information about existing resources. Since the Web is a huge place in 
which everything can link to anything else, it is impossible to rule out that a 
statement could be true, or could become true in the future. For example, if we 
define a class, we usually cannot know all its instances in advance. Likewise, 
we cannot rule out that a specific
<CODE>Product</CODE> will also be used as an
<CODE>AuctionItem</CODE>. This "open-world 
assumption" means that modeling domains for the Semantic Web may require a shift 
in mindset for developers who are used to the closed, finite domains of 
"classical" object-oriented systems or "traditional" relational databases. On 
the other hand side, it offers a bounty of flexibility and shared experience as 
part of a boundless world of opportunties for reuse and interoperability. In 
particular, the open world approach means that any web-based, communal ontology 
can add subclasses or additional characteristics to concepts defined in other 
ontologies to narrow them for a different application case. In closed systems 
such as Java programs this is not easily possible, or conventional practice.</P>
<P>But let us return to the RDF language for now. RDF <EM>properties</EM> can be 
compared to attributes, fields or association ends in object-oriented languages. 
However, while in the UML or Java attributes are attached to a single class 
only, RDF properties are stand-alone entities which can be defined independently 
from classes and used in multiple classes. For example, you can define a 
property <CODE>hasPrice</CODE> and then 
attach it to all classes where a price makes sense. This also makes it possible 
to reuse the same property across multiple files. For example if you create a 
model for online auctioning software, you could use the price property from the 
online shopping model to also represent prices for the auction items. Sharing 
the same property across multiple models means that values can be more easily 
integrated, for example to compare the current auctioning price with the price 
for a new product in other online shops.</P>
<P>In order to &quot;attach&quot; or &quot;associate&quot; a property with a class, 
  rdfs:domain statements can be used. rdfs:domain is a tag from the RDF Schema 
  namespace that relates a property to a class using predication. In the example 
  above, the domain of hasPrice is Product. As such, from an object-oriented point 
  of view this would mean that all instances of the Product class could have price 
  values associated with them, hence making Price a Product attribute. However, 
  in RDF and OWL this also has additional connotations: any resource that is the 
  subject of hasPrice is an instance of the Product class. In other words, a domain 
  statement in RDF can be used to classify instances. Therefore, pointing ack 
  to the above example, if something has a price, then it can be handled as an 
  instance of Product, even if it partakes in other declarations (or triples) 
  - a crucial matter that will be discussed in more detail later in the context 
  of reasoning with OWL.</P>
<P>In this manner, primitive values such as prices are called <EM>literals</EM> 
in RDF, and literals have an XML Schema datatype such as
<CODE>xsd:string</CODE> or
<CODE>xsd:float</CODE> as their types. It is 
possible to limit the type of values of a property using an
<CODE>rdfs:range</CODE> statement. A property can either have an 
XML Schema datatype as its range, or a class. Properties that have classes in 
their range can be compared to relationships in object-oriented languages. For 
example, if the property
<CODE>hasCustomer</CODE> has the range
<CODE>Customer</CODE>, then all values of the 
property must be customers. Similar to domain statements, range statements can 
also be interpreted the other way around: if we know that a resource is related 
by means of the <CODE>hasCustomer</CODE> 
property, then we can infer that the resource is in fact a
<CODE>Customer</CODE>, even if it has other 
types as well. </P>
<H3><A name=owl></A>3.2 OWL</H3>
<P>As shown in the previous paragraphs, RDF Schema defines a simple domain 
modeling language similar to object-oriented languages. You can define classes 
and their properties and then create instances of these classes. This is useful 
for many purposes. However, in many application domains, the expressivity of RDF 
Schema alone is insufficient. For example, RDF Schema cannot express cardinality 
constraints so that each Product can only have one price.</P>
<P>The <EM>Web Ontology Language (OWL)</EM> <A 
href="#ref-OWL-2004">[OWL 
2004]</A> extends RDF Schema and uses the same RDF syntax as its base grammar. 
OWL adds the ability to express more information about the characteristics of 
properties, and to define classes by grouping those instances that meet these 
characteristics. In order to better understand this, it is important to remember 
that OWL classes are sets of axioms. As illustrated in Figure 3, these sets may 
overlap, and they may contain other sets.</P>
<P align=center><IMG height=281 src="sets.png" width=473
alt="OWL classes as sets of instances"></P>
<P align=center>Figure 3: OWL classes can be regarded as sets of instances with 
common characteristics.</P>
<P>The left circle in Figure 3 describes the class of all things that have their 
origin in Australia. The right circle represents all instances of the product 
class. The intersection of the two big circles therefore represents the class of 
all instances that are products and "from Australia" at the same time, i.e. all 
Australian products. Illustrated by the small circle within the products circle, 
the class of those products purchased by someone from Germany is a subset of all 
products. Finally, the set of all Australian products that have been purchased 
by someone from Germany are represented by the intersection of all classes.</P>
<P>Now, let us not forget that RDF/OWL properties are independent from 
particular classes, and can be used in multiple places. For example,the property 
<CODE>hasOrigin</CODE> could be used for 
products, people, customers, music, or whatever. Assuming
<CODE>Australia</CODE> is defined as an instance of
<CODE>Country</CODE> somewhere, somebody could now 
use OWL to formally define the class of all things where the
<CODE>hasOrigin</CODE> property has the value
<CODE>Australia</CODE>. All instances that anyone 
else has defined can then be classified according to this definition.</P>
<P>The OWL language element used to express such definitions is called 
<EM>restriction</EM>. A restriction describes the class of all instances that 
fulfill a specific condition on a property. There are various types of 
restrictions in OWL. In the above example, we have a so-called <EM>hasValue</EM> 
restriction which links a property to a specific individual. Other restrictions 
limit the cardinality of a property, for example to define the class of all 
things that have at least two values for the
<CODE>hasOrigin</CODE> property.</P>
<P>It is not necessary to go into the details of restrictions here. The key 
power of OWL is that classes can be defined by combining multiple restrictions 
and other classes. For that purpose, OWL provides logical operands to build 
intersections (and), unions (or) and complements (not) of other classes. For 
example, you could define "the class of all customers from France who have 
issued at least 3 purchase orders or at least one order consisting only of 
books, except those customers who have ordered a DVD".</P>
<P>In object-oriented systems, such statements would typically have been hidden 
somewhere inside the code base itself. In Semantic Web ontologies, the logical 
relationships are made explicit through OWL class definitions and other formal 
statements. This does not only make it easier for other human users of models to 
understand the specifically intended meaning, but also means that other tools 
can use the definitions transparently. OWL models simply declare things, and it 
is entirely up to the applications to do something useful with these 
declarations.</P>
<P>Some Semantic Web applications can exploit other tools to handle and analyze 
OWL models. One family of such tools is called reasoners. A <EM>reasoner</EM> is 
a service that takes the statements encoded (asserted) in an ontology as input 
and derives (infers) new statements from them. In particular, OWL reasoners can 
be used to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Reveal subclass/superclass relationships among classes 
  <LI>Determine the most specific types of individuals 
  <LI>Detect inconsistent class definitions </LI></UL>
<P>So, a suitable example can be formed as follows: Assume you have defined a 
class <CODE>DutyFreeOrder</CODE>, which 
consists of all <CODE>PurchaseOrder</CODE>s 
that have been issued by customers who belong to the set of all customers that 
live in a free-trade country. Now assume, a new user logs into the onlineshop 
and starts putting items into his shopping basket. Internally we will create 
blank instances of the <CODE>Customer</CODE> 
and <CODE>PurchaseOrder</CODE> classes. Later, 
when the user proceeds to the check out and enters his delivery address, we can 
ask a reasoner to classify the
<CODE>PurchaseOrder</CODE>. This will give us 
the most specific class that the particular order belongs to (here, a
<CODE>DutyFreeOrder</CODE>). The fact that we now 
have a duty free order will control the future life cycle of this object because 
the application logic can exploit additional domain knowledge about duty free 
orders.</P>
<P>In contrast to object-oriented systems, where objects normally cannot change 
their type, applications based on Semantic Web technology can follow a formal, 
yet dynamic typing system. RDF and OWL classes themselves are also dynamic, it 
is possible to create and manipulate them at runtime. For example, one could 
define a temporary class that is formally represented as an OWL expression and 
then ask the reasoner about the instances of this class. This means that 
reasoners can be compared to rich query answering systems. These queries can not 
only be asked at ontology design time, but also at execution time.</P>

<H2><A name=programming></A>4 Programming with RDF Schema and OWL</H2>
<P>Many modern software architectures consist of object-oriented components, 
implemented in mainstream programming languages like Java or C#. In fat-client 
systems, most user interface and control code will be written using 
object-oriented libraries like Swing or SWT. In a client-server setting, the 
server may host Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) which communicate with databases and 
other resources. In Web Services, much of the control logic will be implemented 
using imperative, object-oriented methods.</P>
<P>In order to exploit the benefits of Semantic Web technology in the context of 
such object-based systems, software architects need to understand the design 
patterns and strategies to seamlessly integrate these technologies. While we are 
only beginning to understand the implications of Semantic Web technology in 
systems and Software Engineering, many promising candidate solutions are 
beginning to emerge, including programming APIs and code generators. In this 
section we will give an overview of the state of the art (at the time of writing 
this note) of ontology-driven software development and discusssome of its 
underlying concepts.</P>
<P>The key to understanding ontology-driven architectures is to keep in mind 
that in ontology languages:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Properties are independent from specific classes 
  <LI>Instances can have multiple types and change their type as a result of 
  classification 
  <LI>Classes can be defined dynamically, at runtime </LI></UL>
<P>These key differences imply that it is not sufficient to simply map OWL/RDF 
  Schema classes into OO classes, where attributes are fixed to classes etc. Instead, 
  if an application wants to exploit the weak typing and flexibility of OWL/RDF 
  Schema, it is necessary to map OWL/RDF Schema classes into runtime objects, 
  so that classes in the ontology become instances of some object-oriented class 
  (compare also <A 
href="#ref-G-2003">[G 
  2003]</A> or <A 
href="#ref-KPBP-2004">[KPBP 
  2004</A>]). As illustrated in As illustrated in Figure 4, a typical object model 
  to represent Semantic Web ontologies would contain classes to represent resources, 
  classes, properties and individuals. Note that the terms RDFSClass and RDFProperty 
  relate to the classes rdfs:Class and rdf:Property defined in RDF Schema, whereas 
  the term RDFIndividual has no direct counterpart defined in RDF Schema.</P>
<P>Further extensions for the various types of OWL classes and properties are 
  easy to imagine (see <A 
href="http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/api/ProtegeOWLModel.pdf">Protege 
  OWL Diagram</A> for a complete OWL object model). </P>
<P align=center><IMG height=176 src="dom.png" width=433
alt="simple model representing RDF Schema"></P>
<P align=center>Figure 4: A simple object-oriented model to represent RDF Schema 
ontologies.</P>
<P>Applications would load ontologies into such an object model and then 
manipulate and query the objects at runtime. Since OWL/RDF Schema classes are 
objects, it is possible to add and modify classes, for example to change the 
logical characteristics of an ontology at runtime. Since RDF properties are 
objects (and their values are not stored as object-oriented attributes), it is 
possible to assign and query values for any resource dynamically. Since 
individuals are objects, it is possible to dynamically change their type.</P>
<P>This approach is driven by a dynamic approach to development as is known in 
mainstream software technology as the <EM>Dynamic Object Model</EM> pattern <A 
href="#ref-RTJ-2005">[RTJ 
2005]</A>. For certain object-oriented systems, by representing the object types 
as objects, they can be changed at configuration time or at runtime, making it 
easy to change and adapt the system to new requirements.</P>
<P>In the Semantic Web community, several APIs implement this pattern. Popular 
libraries for Java, C and PHP are listed in the <A 
href="#links">Appendix</A>. 
In addition to the dynamic object model interfaces, these libraries provide 
parsers, reasoning interfaces and various other services for ontology handling. 
To get a feeling of how to use such libraries, the following example Java code 
snippet (a method that calculates the sum of all purchases of a given customer) 
has been provided:</P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE cellSpacing=20 width="80%" bgColor="#eeeeee" border=0>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>public static float getPurchasesSum(RDFIndividual customer) {
    OWLModel owlModel = customer.getOWLModel();
    float sum = 0;
    RDFProperty purchasesProperty = owlModel.getRDFProperty("purchases");
    RDFProperty productProperty = owlModel.getRDFProperty("product");
    RDFProperty priceProperty = owlModel.getRDFProperty("price");
    Iterator purchases = customer.listPropertyValues(purchasesProperty);
    while(purchases.hasNext()) {
        RDFIndividual purchase = (RDFIndividual) purchases.next();
        RDFIndividual product = (RDFIndividual) purchase.getPropertyValue(productProperty);
        Float price = (Float) product.getPropertyValue(priceProperty);
        sum += price.floatValue();
    }
    return sum;
}</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>This code is generic and flexible, but at the same time this approach has 
some disadvantages. If classes and properties are runtime objects, then the 
advantages of a strong type system cannot be used at compile time. It becomes 
rather inconvenient, therefore<STRONG>,</STRONG> to access property values and 
the code is bloated with infrastructure calls to access properties etc. 
Furthermore, resources are accessed by names coded as strings, so most compilers 
cannot assist with error detection. From an object-oriented implementation point 
of view, a much nicer implementation of the method above would look as 
follows:</P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE cellSpacing=20 width="80%" bgColor="#eeeeee" border=0>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>public class Customer extends RDFIndividual {


    public float getPurchasesSum() {
        float sum = 0;
        Iterator purchases = listPurchases();
        while (purchases.hasNext()) {
            Purchase purchase = (Purchase) purchases.next();
            Product product = purchase.getProduct();
            sum += product.getPrice();
        }
        return sum;
    }
}</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>Instead of accessing generic classes such as <SPAN 
class=style1>RDFIndividual</SPAN> and <SPAN class=style1>RDFProperty</SPAN>, we 
  would access custom-tailored classes such as <SPAN class=style1>Purchase</SPAN> 
  and <SPAN class=style1>Product</SPAN>. Fortunately, it is possible to generate 
  and use such classes without sacrificing the advantages of a dynamic object 
  model. Code generators can take an RDFSchema or OWL ontology as input and create 
  object-oriented interfaces and implementation classes as output. A list of some 
  appropriate code generators is provided in the <A 
href="#links">Appendix</A>. 
  In the example above,a generator would create a Java interface <SPAN 
class=style1>Customer</SPAN>, defining get and set methods for the properties 
  that have <SPAN class=style1>Customer</SPAN> in their domain (e.g., <SPAN 
class=style1>getEMail</SPAN>, <SPAN class='style1'>setEMail</SPAN>). These 
  interfaces subclass the generic classes from the Dynamic Object Model API (such 
  as <SPAN class=style1>RDFIndividual</SPAN>). This means that instances of the 
  interfaces are at the same time "normal" <SPAN 
class=style1>RDFIndividuals</SPAN>, while the generated interfaces serve as an 
  (optional) convenience layer on top of it.</P>
<P align=center><IMG height="327" src="generated-classes.png" 
alt="accessing models using generic API or using classes"
width=615></P>
<P align=center>Figure 5: Semantic Web models can be accessed either using a generic 
  API or domain-specific classes.</P>
<P>The fact that the runtime objects are also instances of a generic, dynamic 
  API means that developers can implement against two different APIs, depending 
  on the task. For generic services such as reasoning, parsing, querying, and 
  input validation it is possible to reuse or write code against the Dynamic Object 
  Model API. Generic code has the greatest potential for reuse and suggests that 
  more and more freely available components for processing RDF and OWL will become 
  available in the future. This observation has some implications for the development 
  methodology for ontology-driven systems. In particular, if generic components 
  for reasoning and querying exist, then software designers should encode as much 
  as possible in the RDF/OWL domain model, and thus raise the level of abstraction 
  into the domain of generic services. For example, the fact that orders from 
  countries with a free-trade agreement are duty free could be implemented inside 
  the body of a method such as <SPAN class=style1 
>isDutyFree()</SPAN> in the Java class <SPAN 
class=style1>PurchaseOrder</SPAN>. However, this would make it impossible to exploit 
  generic reasoners to classify a purchase order automatically. A cleaner solution 
  would be to define a subclass <SPAN 
class="style1">DutyFreePurchaseOrder</SPAN> in the OWL ontology, and supply 
  it with Description Logic statements that define how duty free orders differ 
  from other orders. The availability of reusable, generic services is an incentive 
  to build domain models with explicit semantics.</P>
<P>Despite the promises of ontology-driven software development, it is also important 
  to understand when <EM>not</EM> to use Semantic Web technology. Most importantly, 
  many of the reasoning engines mentioned in this document currently have scalability 
  and performance problems. The classification of arbitrary OWL DL ontologies 
  can be an extremely lengthy task and may therefore limit the use of classifiers 
  at runtime. Performance is less critical when reasoners are used at ontology 
  build time.</P>
<P>Other problems with the Semantic Web in general have to do with the limits 
  of ontology reusability. It is difficult to build truly domain independent and 
  reusable ontologies. Furthermore, ontologies are often difficult and expensive 
  to build, and therefore represent an investment which many software companies 
  would not just upload and share openly on the Web. These problems are beyond 
  the scope of this paper, but they are important to keep in mind <A
