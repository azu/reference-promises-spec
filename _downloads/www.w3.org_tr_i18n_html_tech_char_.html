			 or generates HTML documents.</p><p >This document provides guidance for the development of HTML so that it will support international usage.
			 This is the responsibility of all content authors, not just the localization group, and is relevant from the very start

			 CSS2 and some parts of CSS3.</p><p >Note that XHTML source can be served as XML (using MIME types <code class="keyword">application/xhtml+xml</code>,
			 <code class="keyword">application/xml</code> or <code class="keyword">text/xml</code>) or HTML (using the MIME type <code class="keyword">text/html</code>).</p><p >It is very common for XHTML to be served as HTML, following the 
			 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines">compatibility guidelines in Appendix C </a>of the XHTML
			 1.0 specification. This allows authors with the right editing tools to produce valid XML code, which therefore lends
			 itself to processing with such things as scripting or XSLT, but is also well supported for display by most mainstream
			 browsers. (XHTML served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> is not well supported for browser display at the moment.)
			 In this document we wish to reflect practical reality for content authors, so we cover XHTML served as
			 <code class="keyword">text/html</code> in the techniques.</p><p >Indeed we encourage the use of XHTML, and all the examples (unless trying to make a specific point about
			 HTML 4.01) are written in XHTML.</p><p > For XHTML served as XML, this document limits its advice to documents served as
			 <code class="keyword">application/xhtml+xml</code>. Note that user agent support for XHTML served as XML is still patchy.</p></div><div class="div2">

			 about their applicability to particular user agents.</p><p >User agents, in this current version, means a number of mainstream browsers. (The scope may grow as
			 resources and test results become available for other user agents.)</p><p >In an attempt to make the task of tracking browser applicability manageable, we have chosen a 'base version'
			 for each of the user agents we are tracking for applicability. This base version represents a fairly recent,
			 standards-compliant version of the browser. Where a browser operates in both standards- and quirks-mode, standards-mode
			 is assumed (ie. you should use a DOCTYPE statement).</p><p >The base versions considered for this version of the document include:</p><ul ><li><p >Internet Explorer 6 (Windows)</p></li><li><p >Mozilla 1.4</p></li><li><p >Opera 7</p></li><li><p >Netscape Navigator 7</p></li><li><p >Safari</p></li><li><p >Internet Explorer 5 (Mac)</p></li></ul><p >If the technique is applicable to a base version of a user agent the name of that user agent will appear
			 immediately below the summary of the technique. If the technique is not applicable, the name will appear crossed out.
			 If the name does not appear at all, this signifies that further investigation is needed. If the technique is applicable
			 to a later version than the chosen base version, this will be indicated by adding the version number to the name.</p><p >Detailed information may also be provided from time to time about behavior of a user agent in an earlier
			 version than the base version, or about some particular aspect of the behavior of a base version or later user agent.

		  <p >When selecting a page encoding, consider both current and future localization requirements, and the benefits
			 of using the same encoding across all pages and all languages. These considerations make the use of Unicode an
			 attractive choice for the following reasons:</p> 
		  <ul ><li><p >Unicode supports many languages, enabling the use of a single encoding across all pages and forms,
				  regardless of language.</p></li><li><p >Unicode allows many more languages to be mixed on a single page than almost any other choice. If the set
				  of languages to be represented on a single page cannot be represented directly by any single native encoding (such as
				  ISO-8859-1, Shift-JIS, etc.), then Unicode is almost certainly the best choice.</p></li><li><p >For dynamically-generated pages, a single encoding for all pages eliminates the need for server-side
				  logic to determine the character encoding for each page served.</p></li><li><p >For interactive applications using forms, a single encoding eliminates the need for server-side logic to
				  determine the character encoding of incoming form data.</p></li><li><p >Unicode enables a form in one language (e.g. English) to accept input in a different language (e.g.
				  Chinese).</p></li><li><p >Unicode (UTF-8) forms will be easier to migrate to XForms.</p></li></ul> 
		  <p >UTF-8 and UTF-16 are both Unicode encodings. Since support for Unicode is currently limited to UTF-8 in many
			 user agents, UTF-8 is usually the appropriate Unicode encoding. However, as user agent support for UTF-16 expands,
			 UTF-16 will become an increasingly viable alternative.</p> 
		  <p >Although there are other multi-script encodings (such as ISO-2022 and GB18030), Unicode generally provides
			 the best combination of user agent and script support.</p></div><div class="rule"><a id="ri20030112.21374337" name="ri20030112.21374337" href="#ri20030112.21374337">

		  <p >There are some situations where selecting a Unicode encoding is not practical. If content is encoded in a
			 native encoding (legacy content or content originating from an external source) and the system lacks functionality for
			 converting content between encodings, Unicode may greatly complicate implementation. If such a site is only required to
			 serve single-script pages (containing languages that can be represented by a single native encoding), then the cost of
			 using a Unicode encoding may outweigh the benefits. In this case, a native encoding (such as ISO-8859-1, Shift-JIS,
			 etc.) may be a better choice.</p> 
		  <p >Be sure to select an encoding that covers most 
			 of the characters required for the content, and (if it is a form) all

		  <p >Not all user agents support all page encodings, so it is important to understand which user agents must be

		  <p >In general, user agents are most likely to support the commonly-used native character encodings for the
			 major languages used on the web. Support for less commonly used encodings depends on the user agent. Older user agents,
			 or user agents that operate under severe memory limitations, may not support UTF-8.</p> 
		  <p >It is important to note that support for a given encoding does not necessarily imply support for all writing
			 systems that encoding supports. For example, a user agent might support UTF-8, but not correctly display bidirectional

			 <p >According to the HTML specification, in a case of conflict the HTTP charset declaration has the highest

			 <p >Advantages to this approach:</p> 
			 <ul ><li><p >User agents can easily find the character encoding information when it is sent in the HTTP header.</p></li><li><p >The HTTP header information has the highest priority in case of conflict, so this approach should be
					 used by intermediate servers that transcode the data (ie. convert to a different encoding). This is sometimes done for
					 small devices that only recognize a small number of encodings. Because the HTTP header information has precedence over
					 any in-document declaration, it doesn't matter that transcoders typically do not change the internal encoding
					 declarations, just the document encoding.</p></li></ul> 
			 <p >There may be some disadvantages when dealing with static files or templates:</p> 
			 <ul ><li><p >It may be difficult for content authors to change the encoding information on the server - especially
					 when dealing with an ISP. They will need knowledge of and access to the server settings.</p></li><li><p >Server settings may get out of synchronization with the document for one reason or another. This may
					 happen, for example, if you rely on the server default, and that default is changed. This is a very bad situation,

					 unreadable.</p></li></ul> 
			 <p >In addition, there are potential problems for both static and dynamic documents if they are to be saved by
				the user or used from a location such as a CD or hard disk. In these cases encoding information from an HTTP header is
				not available.</p> 
			 <p >Similarly, if the character encoding is only declared in the HTTP header, this information may become
				separated from files that are processed by such things as XSLT or scripts, or from files that are sent for
				translation.</p> 
			 <p >For these reasons you should always ensure that encoding information is <em>also</em> declared inside

			 <p >Advantages to including an XML declaration include the following:</p> 
			 <ul ><li><p >If your document is not encoded in UTF-8 or UTF-16 and the encoding is not declared in an HTTP header,
					 it is necessary to have this in-document encoding declaration when editing or processing the file as XML, eg. using

					 charset statement described earlier.</p></li><li><p >In some cases, you may want to serve the same static document as either HTML or XML, depending on the
					 capabilities of the requesting user agent. This can be achieved by server-side logic. In these cases you will want to
					 have an XML declaration in the document when it is served as XML. (We are assuming that the appropriate declaration can
					 be added to the file via scripting for dynamically created documents.)</p></li></ul>

						XHTML</a>), you may prefer to omit it.</p></li><li><p >The XML declaration is not actually needed for HTML documents (which is what we are discussing here).
					 HTML processors do not use this information, and the encoding information should be included in the meta charset
					 statement described above.</p></li></ul> 
			 <p >In summary we could say the following:</p> 
			 <ul ><li><p >If the XML declaration will not cause your document any harm, it is best to include it. If you do use
					 an XML declaration, you should always declare the encoding in it.</p></li><li><p >If you are worried about the undesirable effects sometimes associated with use of the XML declaration

		Only use escapes for characters in exceptional circumstances. Create pages using an encoding that supports all
		  the characters you need.</a></div><div class="applicability"> IE(Win)  Mozilla  Opera  NNav  Safari  IE(Mac)  </div><div class="description"> 
		  <p >Using escapes can make it difficult to read and maintain source code, and can also significantly increase
			 file size. Many English-speaking developers have the expectation that other languages only make occasional use of
			 non-ASCII characters, but this is wrong.</p> 
		  <p >There are three characters which should always appear in content as escapes, so that they do not interact
			 with the syntax of the markup:</p> 
		  <ul ><li><p >&amp;lt; (&lt;)</p></li><li><p >&amp;gt; (&gt;)</p></li><li><p >&amp;amp; (&amp;)</p></li></ul> 
		  <p >You may also want to represent the double-quote (") as &amp;quot; - particularly in attribute text when you
			 need to use the same type of quotes as you used to surround the attribute value.</p> 
		  <p >Escapes can be useful to represent characters not supported by the encoding you chose for the document. For
			 example, to represent Chinese characters in an ISO Latin 1 document. You should ask yourself first, however, why you
			 have not changed the encoding of the document to something that covers all the characters you need (such as, of course,
			 UTF-8).</p> 
		  <p >If your editing tool does not allow you to easily enter needed characters you may also resort to using
			 escapes. Note that this is not a long-term solution, nor one that works well if you have to enter a lot of such
			 characters - it takes longer and makes maintenance more difficult. Ideally you would choose an editing tool that
			 allowed you to enter these characters as characters.</p> 
		  <p >A potentially very useful role for escapes is for characters that are invisible or ambiguous in
			 presentation.</p> 
		  <p >One example would be Unicode character <span class="uname">200F: RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</span>. This character can be used
			 to clarify directionality in bidirectional text (eg. when using the Arabic or Hebrew scripts). It has no graphic form,
			 however; so it is difficult to see where these characters are in the text, and if they are lost or forgotten they could
			 create unexpected results during later editing. Using &amp;rlm; (or its NCR equivalent &amp;#x200F;) instead makes it
			 very easy to spot these characters.</p> 
		  <p >An example of an ambiguous character is <span class="uname">00A0: NO-BREAK SPACE</span>. This type of space prevents
			 line breaking, but it looks just like any other space when used as a character. Using &amp;nbsp; (or &amp;#xA0;) makes
			 it quite clear where such spaces appear in the text.</p></div><div class="rule"><a id="ri20030112.223703527" name="ri20030112.223703527" href="#ri20030112.223703527">
