            inherent structured data. When publishers can express this data
            more completely, and when tools can read it, a new world of user
            functionality becomes available, letting users transfer structured
            data between applications and web sites. An event on a web page
            can be directly imported into a user's desktop calendar. A license
            on a document can be detected so that the user is informed of his
            rights automatically. A photo's creator, camera setting
            information, resolution, and topic can be published as easily as
            the original photo itself, enabling structured search and sharing.

<h2><a name="id67743" id="id67743"></a>Introduction</h2><p> Current web pages, written in HTML, contain significant inherent
    structured data. When publishers can express this data more completely,
    and when tools can read it, a new world of user functionality becomes
    available, letting users transfer structured data between applications and
    web sites. An event on a web page can be directly imported into a user's

    original photo itself, enabling structured search and sharing. </p><p> RDFa is a syntax that expresses RDF structured data in HTML. An
  important goal of RDFa is to achieve this RDF embedding without repeating
  existing HTML content when that content <em>is</em> the structured data.
  </p><p>
   This document presents the major use cases where embedding
   structured data in HTML using RDFa provides significant
   benefit. Each use case explores how publishers, tool
   builders, and consumers benefit from RDFa. In parallel, the
   reader is encouraged to look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa
   Primer</a> and RDFa Syntax (to be published).
  </p><p>
    In this document, we consider Publishers, Tool Builders, and Users. For simplicity, we give our fictitious users first names whose first letter matches their role: Paul, Patrick, and Peter are publishers, Tim, Tod, and Tara and tool builders, Ursula and Ulrich are users.
  </p><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="id67791" id="id67791"></a>Audience</h3><p>
      This document assumes a reader who has reasonable experience
      with HTML and RDF, in particular N3 notation.
    </p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="id67803" id="id67803"></a>An Overview of the Use Cases</h3><ol><li><a href="#use-case-1"><b>Use Case #1 — Basic Structured Blogging</b></a>: Paul maintains a blog and wishes to
        "mark up" his existing page with structure so that tools can pick up
        his blog post tags, authors, titles, and his blogroll. In particular,
        his HTML blog should be usable as its own structured feed.</li><li><a href="#use-case-2"><b>Use Case #2 — Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</b></a>: Paul sometimes gives talks on various
      topics, and announces them on his blog. He would like to mark up these
      announcements with proper scheduling information, so that RDFa-enabled
      agents can automatically obtain the scheduling information and add it to
      the browsing user's calendar. Importantly, some of the rendered data
      might be more informal than the machine-readable data required to
      produce a calendar event. Also of importance: Paul may want to annotate
      his event with a combination of existing vocabularies and a new
      vocabulary of his own design.</li><li><a href="#use-case-3"><b>Use Case #3 — Content Management Metadata</b></a>: Tod sells an HTML-based content
      management system, where all documents are processed and edited as HTML,
      sent from one editor to another, and eventually published and indexed.
      He would like to build up the editorial metadata within the HTML
      document itself, so that it is easier to manage and less likely to be
      lost.</li><li><a href="#use-case-4"><b>Use Case #4 — Self-Contained HTML Fragments</b></a>: Tara runs a video sharing web site.
      When Paul wants to blog about a video, he can paste a fragment of HTML
      provided by Tara directly into his blog. The video is then available
      inline, in his blog, along with any licensing information (Creative
      Commons?) about the video.</li><li><a href="#use-case-5"><b>Use Case #5 — Web Clipboard</b></a>: Ursula is looking for a new apartment
      and some items with which to furnish it. She browses various
      RDFa-enabled web pages, including apartment listings, furniture stores,
      kitchen appliances, etc. Every time she finds an item she likes, she can
      point to it, extract the locally-relevant structured data expressed
      using RDFa, and transfer it to her apartment-hunting page, where it can
      be organized, sorted, categorized. Any additional features of the HTML
      that are not structured, e.g. links to photos, are conserved by the
      transfer.</li><li><a href="#use-case-6"><b>Use Case #6 — Semantic Wiki</b></a>: Tim runs an RDFa-aware Semantic Wiki,
      where users contribute content in Wiki markup, using a WYSIWYG tool, or
      using HTML+RDFa. In all cases, the semantic wiki produces HTML+RDFa, so
      that users like Ursula can transfer the structured content from one
      semantic wiki (or any other RDFa source) to another semantic wiki (or
      any other RDFa destination). In particular, Ursula may be pasting her
      apartment-and-furnishing finds into her own Semantic Wiki.</li><li><a href="#use-case-7"><b>Use Case #7 — Augmented Browsing for Scientists</b></a>: Patrick writes a science blog where he
      discusses proteins, genes, and chemicals. As he has very little control
      over the layout—he's using a fairly constrained hosting
      provider—, Patrick adds RDFa to indicate the scientific components
      he's working with. Ulrich, a scientist, can browse Patrick's site with
      an RDFa-aware browser and automatically cross-reference the proteins and
      genes that Patrick is talking about.</li><li><a href="#use-case-8"><b>Use Case #8 — Advanced Data Structures</b></a>: Patrick keeps a list of his
       scientific publications on his web site. Using the BibTex vocabulary,
       he would like to provide structure within this publications page so
       that Ulrich, who browses the web with an RDFa-aware client, can
       automatically extract this information and use it to cite Patrick's
       papers.</li><li><a href="#use-case-9"><b>Use Case #9 — Publishing a RDF Vocabulary</b></a>: Paul wants to publish a large
       vocabulary in RDFS and/or OWL. Paul also wants to provide a clear,
       human readable description of the same vocabulary. Using RDFa, the
       terms themselves can be mixed with a descriptive text in HTML. The RDFa
       engine can then extract the vocabulary in RDF/XML and/or n3 formats, to
       be included used directly by RDF aware applications (eg,
       reasoners).</li></ol></div></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="use-case-1" id="use-case-1"></a>Use Case #1 — Basic Structured Blogging</h2><p>Paul maintains a blog and wishes to "mark up" his existing page with
  structure so that tools can pick up his blog post tags, authors, titles, and
  his blogroll, and so that he does not need to maintain a parallel version of
  his data in "structured format." For this purpose, Paul chooses the FOAF and
  Dublin Core vocabularies.</p><p>
    Paul's starting HTML (before RDFa) is:
  </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Paul's Blog&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
...
    &lt;div id="www2007_talk"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;My WWW2007 Talk&lt;/h2&gt;
    a post by Paul.
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm giving a talk at the WWW2007 Conference about structured blogging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
...
    &lt;div id="blogroll"&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://example.org/tim#me"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://example.org/Ursula#me"&gt;Ursula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
...
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://example.org/tod#me"&gt;Tod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
...
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div>
(<a href="scenario-1.html">html</a>)

  <p>
    and the desired RDF triples, meant to reuse the corresponding text and link targets from the HTML above, are:
  </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
    
&lt;#www2007_talk&gt; dc:title "My WWW2007 Talk" ;
                dc:creator "Paul" .

&lt;#me&gt; foaf:knows &lt;http://example.org/Tim#me&gt; ;
      foaf:knows &lt;http://example.org/Ursula#me&gt; ;
      foaf:knows &lt;http://example.org/Tod#me&gt; .
</pre></div>
(<a href="scenario-1.n3">n3</a>)

    <p> A user with an RDFa-aware browser can automatically pick up Paul's
    list of acquaintances. An RDFa-aware newsreader can use the HTML page
    itself as a newsfeed, rather than seek out a separate, parallel RSS or
    Atom file. Importantly, if Paul edits one of his blog posts, the
    corresponding structured data is also automatically updated. The
    RDFa-aware newsreader will automatically pick up the updated title,
    content, and tags. </p><p> Note that many blog publishing tools already provide an "auto-update"
    feature: they generate multiple output formats at the same time, either by
    "re-baking" the entire site when an update is committed, or by dynamically
    generating a response to each query. With RDFa, the blog publishing engine
    can be significantly simplified: it only needs to produce an HTML+RDFa
    output, which is usable by both humans and automated feed readers. In
    addition, the structured data now naturally includes information not
    typically seen in newsfeeds: the user's blogroll, contact information,
    geo-location, etc., which newsreaders can begin to pick up as they see
    fit.</p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="use-case-2" id="use-case-2"></a>Use Case #2 — Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</h2><p> Paul sometimes gives talks on various topics, and announces them on his
  blog, as well as on a static page of his web site that archives all of the
  talks he's given. He would like to mark up these announcements with proper
  scheduling information, so that RDFa-enabled agents can automatically obtain
  the scheduling information and add it to the browsing user's calendar.
  Importantly, some of the rendered data might be more informal than the
  machine-readable data required to produce a calendar event. In addition,
  Paul wants to add structured data using a combination of existing Dublin
  Core, vcal, and some of his own terms he uses to categorize the audience of
  his talks.</p><p>
    Paul's HTML is:
  </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>...
&lt;div id="www2007_talk"&gt;
  
    &lt;h2&gt;My WWW2007 Talk&lt;/h2&gt;
    a post by Paul.

    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm giving a talk at the WWW2007 Conference about structured blogging,
	on the second day of the conference at 10. This will be one of my
	&lt;a href="technical"&gt;more technical talks&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
...
</pre></div>
(<a href="scenario-2.html">html</a>)

<p>
  and his desired RDF triples are:
</p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>@prefix cal: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ical#&gt;
@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
@prefix paul: &lt;http://example.org/Paul/ns#&gt;

&lt;#www2007_talk&gt; a cal:Vevent ;
                dc:title "My WWW2007 Talk" ;
                dc:creator "Paul" ;
                cal:summary "structured blogging" ;
                cal:dtstart "20070509T1000-0800" ;
                paul:audience &lt;technical&gt; .
</pre></div>
(<a href="scenario-2.n3">n3</a>)

<p> When Ursula points her RDFa-enabled web browser to Paul's blog, she
notices a calendar icon next to the event description. By clicking on it, she
gets the option to add the event to her calendar of choice. Note that the
rendered HTML uses informal language to describe the scheduling of the event,
i.e. "the second day of the conference," while the structured data contains
the complete iCal timestamp. In addition, the structured data also contains
the Dublin Core properties. Finally, though Ursula may not know what to make
of the <code>paul:audience</code> predicate, she can quickly find out what
this predicate means using typical RDF navigation.</p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="use-case-3" id="use-case-3"></a>Use Case #3 — Content Management Metadata</h2><p>
    Tod sells an HTML-based content management system, where all
    documents are processed and edited as HTML, sent from one
    editor to another, and eventually published and indexed. He
    would like to build up the editorial metadata within the
    HTML document itself, so that the metadata is never lost.
  </p><p> For this purpose, Tod's software uses RDFa with non-rendered metadata.
  Peter, one of Tod's customers, runs Foo Magazine, which ships content to
  aggregators and business partners using HTML. As Peter performs editorial
  tasks using Tod's content management system, metadata properties are added
  to the document. These data are not rendered, but they can be extracted
  using a generic RDFa parser. Peter can thus insert a block of workflow and
  rights reuse metadata about the document and its components at a single
  point in the XHTML file and then ship the document off to a business
  partner. </p><p>
    Peter's baseline HTML, not including the RDFa, is:
  </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Add Some Tex Mex Sizzle to Your Kid's Lunch&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Add Some Tex Mex Sizzle to Your Kid's Lunch&lt;/h1&gt;

<h2><a name="use-case-4" id="use-case-4"></a>Use Case #4 — Self-Contained HTML Fragments</h2><p>
    Tara runs a video sharing web site. Paul frequently blogs
    about videos. Some are his own, which he distributes
    exclusively, while others are videos from Tara's site which
    he reviews. When Paul wants to blog about a video from
    Tara's site, he can paste a fragment of HTML provided by Tara
    directly into his blog:
  </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;
    &lt;param name="movie" value="http://example.org/tara/video_123"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;

  The US Constitution, a Documentary.

    CC License
  &lt;/a&gt;. Please provide credit to Tara.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>
(<a href="scenario-4.html">html</a>)

<p> Once augmented with RDFa, the HTML fragment above can be copied and pasted
into Paul's blog post, carrying along with it the following triples: </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>@prefix cc: &lt;http://creativecommons.org/ns#&gt;
@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;

</pre></div>
(<a href="scenario-4.n3">n3</a>)

  <p> When Paul uses the HTML+RDFa markup provided by Tara, the video is then
  available inline, in his blog, along with this structured title and
  licensing information about the video. A user browsing Paul's blog with an
  RDFa-aware browser can tell that the video shared from Tara's site is
  licensed under Creative Commons.</p><p>Note specifically that the HTML+RDFa markup allows Paul to display,
  within a single HTML page, multiple videos, each with its own license,
  title, and other structured information. The videos excerpted from Tara's
  site may be available under a Creative Commons license, while Paul's own
  videos are licensed under different terms.</p><p>Note also that Tara has already used the XHTML reserved keyword license in the HTML <code>rel</code> attribute. RDFa should play along with these existing reserved words.

<h2><a name="use-case-5" id="use-case-5"></a>Use Case #5 — Web Clipboard</h2><p> Ursula is looking for a new apartment and some items with which to
  furnish it. She browses various RDFa-enabled web pages, including apartment
  listings, furniture stores, kitchen appliances, etc. Every time she finds an
  item she likes, she can point to it, extract the locally-relevant structured
  data expressed using RDFa, and transfer it to her apartment-hunting page,
  where it can be organized, sorted, categorized. Any additional features of
  the HTML that are not structured, e.g. links to photos, are conserved by the
  transfer. </p><p>Importantly, the structured data represented by the RDFa is easy to
localize to a particular region of the rendered screen, so that Ursula can
"point and click" her way to the structured data.The data Ursula aggregates
can then be managed using any set of existing RDF tools for querying, sorting,
and navigating. </p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="use-case-6" id="use-case-6"></a>Use Case #6 — Semantic Wiki</h2><p> Tim runs an RDFa-aware Semantic Wiki (as <a href="#SMW">[SMW]</a>), where
  users contribute content in Wiki markup, using a WYSIWYG tool, or using
  HTML+RDFa. In all cases, the semantic wiki produces HTML+RDFa, so that users
  like Ursula can transfer the structured content from one semantic wiki (or
  any other RDFa source) to another semantic wiki (or any other RDFa
  destination). In particular, Ursula may be pasting her
  apartment-and-furnishing finds, from <a href="#use-case-5"><b>Use Case #5 — Web Clipboard</b></a>, into her
  own Semantic Wiki.
</p><p> The key principle here is that HTML+RDFa should remain transferable,
almost first class: structured data from one location can be transferred to
another location, where it can be rendered as HTML, from where it can be once
again extracted and transferred.</p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="use-case-7" id="use-case-7"></a>Use Case #7 — Augmented Browsing for Scientists</h2><p> Patrick writes web-based science articles where he discusses proteins,
  genes, and chemicals. As he has very little control over the
  layout—he's using a fairly constrained hosting provider—,
  Patrick adds RDFa to indicate the scientific components with which he's
  working. Note that Patrick clearly wants to reuse the large vocabularies
  already defined by the scientific community over the years, for example, in
  this case, the Uniprot vocabulary <a href="#UNIPROT">[UNIPROT]</a>. Ulrich, a
  scientist, can then browse Patrick's site with an RDFa-aware browser and
  automatically cross-reference the proteins and genes that Patrick is talking
  about with his own data. </p><p> Specifically, Patrick may write the following blog post (pre-RDFa):
  </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>&lt;div&gt;
    Let's talk about the Corticotropin-lipotropin precursor protein, aka UPA3_HUMAN.
...
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div>
  (<a href="scenario-7.html">html</a>)
  
  <p>
    into which he would like to insert the following triples:
  </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>@prefix uniprot: &lt;urn:lsid:uniprot.org:ontology:&gt;

uniprot:P30089 a uniprot:Protein ;
               uniprot:name "Corticotropin-lipotropin precursor" ;
               uniprot:mnemonic "UPA3_HUMAN" .
</pre></div>
  (<a href="scenario-7.n3">n3</a>)

  <p>
    Then, Ulrich, who runs an RDFa-aware web browser (e.g. Firefox with a GreaseMonkey plugin), is provided with automatic popups with additional information for all proteins, genes, etc. in Patrick's blog. In particular, Ulrich may get links to related proteins, genes, and publications, where Patrick only added a bit of static markup.
  </p><p>

      Of course, this kind of augmented scientific browsing should be useful
      even for large publishers of scientific data, e.g. NCBI <a href="#NCBI">[NCBI]</a>. Relationships between genes, proteins, and scientific
      literature should be expressible as easily as the HTML that embodies the
      same ideas.

  </p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="use-case-8" id="use-case-8"></a>Use Case #8 — Advanced Data Structures</h2><p>Patrick keeps a list of his scientific publications on his web
        site. Using the BibTex vocabulary, he would like to provide structure
        within this publications page so that Ulrich, who browses the web with
        an RDFa-aware client, can automatically extract this information and
        use it to cite Patrick's papers without having to transcribe the
        bibliographic information.</p><p> Two important features of the BibTex vocabulary are worth
        highlighting for this use case: the structure is more than one-level deep, and ordering counts (i.e. who is first author?).</p><p>
          Specifically, Patrick may have the following HTML (pre-RDFa):

<h2><a name="use-case-9" id="use-case-9"></a>Use Case #9 — Publishing a RDF Vocabulary</h2><p> Paul wants to publish a vocabulary in RDFS and/or OWL. He also
        wants to provide a clear, human readable description of the same
        vocabulary. Using RDFa, the terms themselves can be mixed with a
        descriptive text in HTML. The RDFa engine can then extract the
        vocabulary in RDF/XML and/or n3 formats, to be included used directly
        by RDF aware applications (eg, reasoners). </p><p>
            Consider, specifically, the SKOS example in RDF/XML:
        </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>&lt;skos:Concept rdf:about="http:/example.com/Concept/0001"&gt;
  &lt;skos:prefLabel&gt;English cuisine&lt;/skos:prefLabel&gt;
  &lt;skos:altLabel&gt;English dishes&lt;/skos:altLabel&gt;
  &lt;skos:altLabel xml:lang="fr"&gt;Cuisine anglaise&lt;/skos:altLabel&gt;
  &lt;skos:inScheme rdf:resource="http:/example.com/thesaurus"/&gt;
  &lt;skos:broader rdf:resource="http:/example.com/Concept/0002"/&gt;
  &lt;skos:related rdf:resource="http:/example.com/Concept/0003"/&gt;
&lt;/skos:Concept&gt;
</pre></div><p>
            An HTML expression (pre-RDFa) of this SKOS concept might look like:
        </p><div class="exampleInner"><pre>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;English Cuisine&lt;/h2&gt;
    (also called "English dishes", or, in French, "Cuisine anglaise")

    go up to the broader &lt;a href="http://example.com/Concept/0002"&gt;Concept #2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
    
    visit the related &lt;a href="http:/example.com/Concept/0003"&gt;Concept #3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
    
    part of &lt;a href="http://example.com/thesaurus"&gt;the Example Thesaurus&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div><p>
        Expressing a SKOS vocabulary may not require any additional features
        to those described in prior use cases. However, it is important to
        consider whether RDFa can indeed express the complexity of SKOS, which
        may not be captured in other examples.
    </p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="id68510" id="id68510"></a>Comparison to Microformats</h2><p> Some RDFa use cases may be fulfilled by microformats <a href="#MF">[MF]</a>. In particular, Use Case #1 and part of Use Case #2 can be achieved using
  XFN <a href="#XFN">[XFN]</a> and hCal <a href="#HCAL">[HCAL]</a>. In such cases,
  microformats (possibly combined with GRDDL) provide a perfectly appropriate
  solution. However, in each of the use cases in this document, the
  microformat approach requires either building a new, complete vocabulary, or
  <em>mixing</em> several vocabularies in one single application. While this
  may be simple in the case of the basic existing microformats, it becomes
  prohibitive when large vocabularies are used, as in <a href="#use-case-7"><b>Use Case #7 — Augmented Browsing for Scientists</b></a> or simply when the number of vocabularies mixed within
  an application becomes too large. RDFa aims to combine, remix, and extend
  <em>existing</em> vocabularies easily, thus fully enabling <a href="#use-case-2"><b>Use Case #2 — Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</b></a>, <a href="#use-case-3"><b>Use Case #3 — Content Management Metadata</b></a>, and <a href="#use-case-7"><b>Use Case #7 — Augmented Browsing for Scientists</b></a>. </p><p> In addition, RDFa aims to define a single, non-domain-specific syntax,
  so that fragments of HTML+RDFa may be consistently interpretable.
  Specifically, consider <a href="#use-case-4"><b>Use Case #4 — Self-Contained HTML Fragments</b></a>, <a href="#use-case-5"><b>Use Case #5 — Web Clipboard</b></a>, and <a href="#use-case-6"><b>Use Case #6 — Semantic Wiki</b></a>, where it is crucial
  that a single self-contained HTML fragment be complete enough to carry
  through the entire RDF structure.</p></div><div class="div1">
