  <p>The Resource Description Framework
  (<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>) is a 
  general-purpose language for representing information in the Web.</p>

  <p>This document defines <em>Notation 3</em> (also known as <em>N3</em>),
   an assertion and logic language which is a superset of <a>RDF</a>. 
   N3 extends the RDF datamodel by adding formulae 
  (literals which are graphs themselves), variables, 
  logical implication, and functional predicates, 
  as well as providing an textual syntax alternative to RDF/XML.</p>

This January 2008
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/">W3C Team Submission</a>,
with its linked grammars and test suites,
defines the N3 language. It is the product of
experience with working code since 2000, and much discusssion in secifically the
W3C RDF Interest Group and Semantic Web Interest Groups.
It may be put into W3C note form, or even Recommendation track form, in the future.
There is a large amount of implementation with N3 and its subsets.
There also a large number of tests.
However, the test suite has not been completely vaidated against the grammar.

    <h2 id="intro" class="note">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is the specification of the Notation3 language, of internet Media Type
text/rdf+n3.
Normative parts of the specification are <span>thus</span>. 
<span class="note">Non-normative parts and comments thus</span>.
    </p>
    
<p class="note">This is a language which is a compact and readable alternative
to RDF's XML syntax, but also is extended to allow greater
expressiveness. It has subsets, one of which is RDF 1.0 equivalent,
and one of which is RDF plus a form of RDF rules.</p>
<p class="note">This document is a specification of the language
suitable for those familiar with the general concepts. The
developer learning N3 is invited to try the <a href=
"/2000/10/swap/doc/Overview.html">A tutorial</a>, while
implementers looking for for a particular detail of the definition
of the logic are steered toward the <a href="/DesignIssues/N3Logic">operational
semantics.</a> There is also a list of <a href="/DesignIssues/N3Resources">other
N3 resources</a>.</p>
<p class="note">This language has ben developed in the context of the Semantic
Web Interest Group. Comments on this document should be sent to
public-cwm-talk@w3.org</p>
<p class="note">The aims of the language are</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>to optimize expression of data and logic in the same
language,</li>
<li>to allow RDF to be expressed,</li>
<li>to allow rules to be integrated smoothly with RDF,</li>
<li>to allow quoting so that statements about statements can be
made, and</li>
<li>to be as readable, natural, and symmetrical as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">The language achieves these with the following features:</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>URI abbreviation using prefixes which are bound to a namespace
(using @prefix) a bit like in XML,</li>
<li>Repetition of another object for the same subject and predicate
using a comma ","</li>
<li>Repetition of another predicate for the same subject using a
semicolon ";"</li>
<li>Bnode syntax with a certain properties just put the properties
between [ and ]</li>
<li>Formulae allowing N3 graphs to be quoted within N3 graphs using
{ and }</li>
<li>Variables and quantification to allow rules, etc to be
expressed</li>
<li>A simple and consistent grammar.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grammar">Grammar</h2>
<p>The grammar of N3 is defined by a context free grammar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2000/10/swap/grammar/n3.n3">Context-free grammar in N3</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
While this obviously provides a bootstrap problem for implementers,
it is a common format one would expect N3 developers to share.
Non-authoritative generated copies of the same grammar are provided
in the following dialects:
</p> 
<table border="1">

<tr>

<h3 id="tests">Test Suite</h3>

<p>The N3 test suite provides a check for implementers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/n3/">Test suite space</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">
The work of validating the grammar and test suite against each other
is not complete.</p>

<h3 id="encoding">Encoding</h3>
<p>N3 files are encoded in UTF-8 (See <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt">RFC2279</a>), in normalized
in <a href=
"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/">Normalization
Form</a> C. The language is defined in terms of a sequence of
Unicode characters.</p>
<p class="note">(Implementations may chose to implement using 8-bit
bytes, passing bytes &gt;7F transparently, but this will not allow
them to check the validity of embedded non-ASCII characters.
Note
also that some systems internally use UTF-16 encoding
which uses 16 bits as a rule, but allows full 20-bit unicode code points to be
encoded as two 16-bit units. This may be a suitable
implementation for a system which passes such characters without
counting them or breaking apart strings of them. A full 32 unicode
implementation would normally be preferable.)</p>

<p class="note">The exact set of unicode character to be allowed in
(a) literal strings or (b) identifiers may need to be revised if
the unicode specification is revised in unanticipated ways in the
future)</p>

<h3 id="mimetype">MIME type text/n3; charset=utf-8</h3>
<p>This document defines, in the linked grammar, the allowable
syntax and, for documents of valid syntax, the meaning, of a
document in the [proposed] <code>text/rdf+n3</code> MIME type
(Internet Content Type). It also defines the fragment identifier
syntax and semantics.</p>
<p>As the type is in the text tree, agents which do not understand
it will and should display it as text for human consumption.</p>
<h4 id="charset">MIME parameter: charset</h4>
<p>This MIME type is used with a <em>charset</em> parameter: the
encoding is always <em>utf-8.</em> The only occasion that the
encoding can be omitted is when it happens (and is guaranteed by
the sender) that all of the unicode characters in the file are in
fact that subset which is the 7-bit ASCII set. This is because the
default encoding for types in the text/* tree is ASCII.</p>



<h4 id="frag">Fragment identifier syntax and semantics</h4>
<p>The fragment identifier part of a URI where the rest of the URI
is that of an information resource which has a representation in N3
is used to identify any thing whatever, abstract or concrete.</p>
<p>The N3 representation may give information about that thing by
including its URI as one of the terms in a statement.</p>
<p>The fragment identifier syntax should match the syntax for the
part of a qname after the colon. The qname syntax can be used
within the document to refer to the thing the full URI identifies.</p>
<p class="note">It is good practice to use URIs of this form to
identify things, and to ensure that the N3 document which is served
to the inquirer contains useful information which the publisher of
the information, and owner of the URI, considers relevant, useful
and interesting to any agent (human or machine) dereferencing the
URI. It is good practice to include statements relating the thing
to other things, also identified by URIs. The use of URIs whose
part before the hash sign is a different information resource
constitutes a form of link, leading an agent to possibly dereference
the other URI and gain more information.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax details</h2>
<p class="note">This section describes the syntax which is not
given by the grammar. If a parser is generated automatically from
the grammar, the tokenizer must be written to take the following
into account.</p>
<h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h3>
<p>Tokenizing and white space is not specified in the grammar for
simplicity. White space must be inserted whenever the following
token could start with a character which could extend the preceding
token. Whitespace may not be inserted within a token, except that
it may be freely added and removed whitespace within a URI between
angle brackets. This allows complex URIs to be broken onto several
lines, which in turn allows N3 to be sent for example of email
systems in which a limited line length.</p>
<p>All URIs are quoted with angle brackets. Whitespace within the
&lt;&gt; is to be ignored. Whitespace may therefore be used on
output to split a long URI between lines.</p>
<h3 id="base">Base URI</h3>
<p>The <em><strong>@base</strong></em> directive sets the base 
URI to be used for the parsing of relative URIs.
It takes, itself, a relative URI, so it can be used to 
change the base URI relative to the previous one.
</p>
<h4 id="ex1">Example</h4>
<pre>
@base  &lt;http://example.org/products/>.
...
@base  &lt;prod123/>.
...
@base  &lt;../>.

</pre>
<p>Note that if files are to be concatenated, the base URI
of one may adversely affect parsing of another, unless @base is avoided, or
used consistently with absolute URIs.
</p>
<h3 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h3>
<p>The <em><strong>@prefix</strong></em> directive binds a prefix
to a namespace URI. It indicates that a qualified name (qname) with
that prefix will thereafter be a shorthand for a URI consisting of
the concatenation of the namespace identifier and the bit of the
qname to the right of the (only allowed) colon.</p>
<p>The namespace prefix may be empty, in which case the qname
starts with a colon. This is known as the default namespace. The
empty prefix "" is by default , bound to "#" -- the local namespace of the file.
The parser behaves as though there were a</p>
<pre>@prefix : &lt;#>.
</pre>
<p>just before the file. This
means that <code>&lt;#foo&gt;</code> can be written
<code>:foo</code> and using <code>@keywords</code> one can reduce
that to <code>foo</code>.</p>
<h3 id="keywords">@keywords</h3>
<p>Keywords are a very limited set of alphanumeric strings which
are in the grammar prefixed by an at sign "@".</p>
<p class="note">Qnames using the default namespace which has an
empty prefix start with a colon. The language becomes more readable
when keywords and/or qnames can be written without the at sign or
colon prefix, but clearly one cannot do both.</p>
<p class="note">In many languages similar to N3, there is a risk of
ambiguity as to whether a naked alphanumeric string is a keyword
or an identifier. Serious version management problems occur when
new keywords are added to a language, changing things which were
identifiers into keywords. N3 is designed to be extended in the
future, and possibly branched into specific languages such as query
languages. For this reason, an N3 document can declare which
keywords it uses without the at sign. This allows N3 to be extended
without the danger that existing documents be incorrectly
interpreted by future systems, or future documents by existing
systems.</p>
<p>If no @keywords directive is given, qualified names all have
colons, and unquoted alphanumerics are all keywords. Only the
keywords <code>is</code>, <code>of</code>, and <code>a</code> may
be used naked.</p>
<p>If the <strong>@keywords</strong> directive is given, the
keywords given will thereafter be recognized without a "@" prefix,
and anything else is a local name in the default namespace. Any
keyword may still be given, even if not in the keyword list, by
prefixing it with "@". Because keywords are declared in this way,
we will have the freedom later to make extensions to the syntax
using new keywords without fear of ambiguity. However, the
tokenizer has to be aware of the <code>@keywords</code>
setting.  The grammar is written as without reference to the keywords
system at all, on the assumption that the string has been preprocessed
by a keyword processor to put a "@" on all keywords and a ":" on all
qnames in the default namespace.</p>

<h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>
<p>The """value""" string form is used simply for multi-line values
or values containing quote marks.</p>
<p class="note">The Unicode sets have been defined to be compatible
with those used in XML 1.1.  Unicode has changed over the years,
and the intention of this specification would be to change
if necessary. However, it is understood that the character ranges in the
grammar should be stable even though   the introduction of a few new code
points into the Unicode system.
</p>
<h3 id="escaping">String escaping</h3>
<p>Escaping in strings uses the same conventions as <a href=
"http://www.python.org/doc/current/ref/strings.html">Python
strings</a> except for a \U extension introduced by NTriples spec.
N3 strings represent ordered sequences of Unicode characters.</p>
<p>Some escapes (\a, \b, \f, \v) should be avoided because the
corresponding characters are not allowed in RDF.</p>

</table>
<p>In N3, the double quote character is used for strings. The
single quote character is reserved for future use. The single quote
character does not need to be escaped in an N3 string.</p>
<p class="note">**RDF and N3 are defined in terms of characters,
not bytes. Therefore, the \ooo and \xhh escapes are not used.</p>
<p>The hexadecimal digit as in unicode escapes are UPPERCASE. This
is designed to match the <a href=
"/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntrip_strings">NTriples strings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="semantics">Semantics</h2>
<p class="note">This section describes the meaning of the
productions in the grammar</p>
<p>An N3 document encodes a set of statements, and its meaning is
the conjunction of the meaning of the statements.</p>

<p>The statement of the form <code>x p y.</code> asserts that the
relation p holds between x and y. The semantics of statements,
where they are valid RDF statements, are those described in the RDF
abstract syntax document [RDFAS].</p>
<p class="note">When p is identified by a URI, and that URI when
dereferenced in the Web gives some information, that information
may in practice be used to determine more information about the
semantics of the statement.</p>
<p>In property lists, the semicolon <em>;</em> is shorthand for
repeating the subject. In object lists <em>,</em> is shorthand for
repeating the verb.</p>
<h3 id="shorthand">Shorthand for common predicates</h3>
<p>For three URIs commonly used as predicates, N3 provides a
special shorthand syntax. This may only be used in the predicate
position in a statement. The RDF type predicate shorthand is the
keyword <code>a</code>. (This needs no @ sign, unless @keyword is
given and it is not in the keyword list.)</p>

</table>
<h3 id="bnodes">Blank nodes</h3>
<p>There are several ways in N3 of representing a blank, or unnamed
node: the underscore namespace, the square bracket syntax, and the
path syntax.</p>
<h4 id="underscore">Underscore namespace</h4>

<p>N3 allows has a special _: namespace prefix. An identifier of such
a form (e.g. <code>_:a17</code>)
represents an blank node. The name a17 is only used 
in the serialization to connect different mentionings of the same node.
There is no commitment to it as a name.
It may not be used as a URI. A serialization which uses arbitrary
different node identifiers is completely equivalent, as is
one which uses the other blank node syntaxes below for the same data.
</p>

<p>When formulae are nested, _: blank nodes syntax used to only identify
blank node in the formula it occurs directly in.
It is an arbitrary temporary name for a symbol which is
existentially quantified within the current formula (not the whole
file). They can only be used within a single formula, and not
within nested formulae.</p>

<p class="note">This is the one blank node syntax
available even in the NTriples minimal subset of N3.</p>


<h4 id="anonbnode">Square bracket blank node syntax</h4>
<p><code>[ pl ]</code> means <em>x</em>, where there exists some
<em>x</em> such that x has properties in the property list
<code>pl</code>. For example,</p>
<p><code>[ :firstname "Ora" ] dc:wrote [ dc:title "Moby Dick" ] .</code></p>
<p>is a statement which would be means in math</p>
<p>exists x, y . firstname(x, "Ora") &amp; dc:wrote(x,y) &amp;
dc:title (y, "Moby Dick")</p>
<p>or in english "Some person who has a first name Ora wrote a book
entitled "Moby Dick". Note <strong>not</strong> "<em>the</em> book"
or "<em>the</em> person".</p>
<p>This can equally well be written</p>
<p>[x:firstname "Ora" ; dc:wrote [dc:title "Moby Dick" ]] .</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>[] x:firstname "Ora" ; dc:wrote [dc:title "Moby Dick" ].</p>
<p>The [] maybe read loosely as "something".</p>
<h4 id="path">Paths</h4>
<p>These are just shorthand. <em>x</em>!<em>p</em> means [ is
<em>p</em> of <em>x</em> ] in the above anonymous node notation.
You can read it as "x's p". This is a little reminiscent of the "."
in object oriented programming "object.slot" syntax.</p>

<p>The reverse traversal, <em>x</em>^<em>p</em> means [ <em>p</em>
<em>x</em> ] . For either forward or backward traversal, <em>p</em>
is a property, and <em>x</em> can be a whole path with both ! and ^
in it.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p><code>:joe!fam:mother!loc:office!loc:zip</code> Joe's mother's
office's zipcode</p>
<p><code>:joe!fam:mother^fam:mother</code> Anyone whose mother is
Joe's mother.</p>
<h3 id="Quoting">Formulae</h3>
<p>An RDF document parses to a set of statements, or graph. However
RDF itelf has no datatype allowing a graph as a literal value. N3
extends RDF allows a graph itself to be referred to within the
language, where it is known as a <dfn>formula</dfn>. A {
statementlist } is a formula whose meaning is the the logical
conjunction (equivalent to syntactic juxtaposition) of the
statements in the list. It is a set, as the same statement occuring
more than once has no meaning. It is unordered set.</p>
<h4 id="ex2">Example:</h4>
<pre>
{ [ x:firstname  "Ora" ] dc:wrote [ dc:title  "Moby Dick" ] } a n3:falsehood .
</pre>
<p>This claims that the expression in {braces} is false - that
there is nothing called Ora which wrote anything titled "Moby
Dick".</p>
<p>A formula is considered, like a literal string, to be defined
only by its contents.</p>
<h3 id="Quantifica">Quantification</h3>
<p>Apart from the set of statements, a formula also has a set of
URIs of symbols which are universally quantified, and a set of URIs
of symbols which are existentially quanitified. Variables are then
in general symbols which have been quantified. There is a also a
shorthand syntax ?x which is the same as :x except that it implies
that x is universally quantified not in the formula but in its
parent formula</p>
<p>The semantics of a formula are than the contents are quoted.
Variable substitution <strong>does</strong> recursively take place
within a formula, but substitution of equals does
<strong>not</strong>. The variable substitution is used for example
when formulae are used for rules, and patch file formats. See the
<a href="/2000/10/swap/doc/Rules">tutorial introduction</a> to
rules.</p>
<p>Certain propoerties may, by their semantics, allow the
propagataion of substitution of equals, by agents which are aware
of that semantics. So for example, if the statement { F ex:or G }
is true, where F and G are formulae, then it ise useful to define a
disjunction operator ex:or such that if a = b, then it is also true
that { F ex:or G' } where G' is the result or substituiting b for a
in G.</p>
<p>The <code>@forAll</code> directives declare variables which are
universally quantified: the formula is true for any value of the
variable. Similarly, <code>@forSome</code> gives an existential
quantification: there exists some value of the variable for which
the formula is true. (Note also that the blank node notations above
all introduce
introduce a blank node, which is an unnamed existential
variable)</p>
<pre>
@forSome &lt;#g&gt;. &lt;#g&gt; &lt;#loves&gt; &lt;#you&gt;
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>
[ &lt;#loves&gt; &lt;#you&gt; ] .
</pre>
<p>If both universal and existential quantification are specified
for the same formula, then the scope of the universal
quantification is outside the scope of the existentials:</p>
<pre>
@forAll &lt;#h&gt;. @forSome &lt;#g&gt;. &lt;#g&gt; &lt;#loves&gt; &lt;#h&gt; .
</pre>
<p>means</p>
<pre>
for all h<br />
   for some g<br />
     g loves h
</pre>
<p>("Every has someone who loves them" rather than "Somebody loves
everybody")</p>
<p>which you might think of as</p>
<p>&forall;h(&exist;g(loves(g,h))</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>
Notation3 in practice uses lists frequently, as ordered containers,
as argument lists to Nary functions, and so on. Implementations may
treat <em>list</em> as a data type rather than just a ladder of rdf:first
and rdf:rest properties. The use of rdf:first and rdf:rest can be
regarded as a reification of the list datatype.<br />
This use of lists requires more axioms than are actually defined in
the RDF specification.</p>
<ol>
<li>All lists exist. The statement <span style=
"font-family: monospace;">[rdf:first &lt;a&gt;; rdf:rest
rdf:nil].</span> carries no information in that the list ( ,a&gt; )
exists and this expression carries no new information about
it.</li>
<li>A list has only one rdf:first. rdf:first is functional. If the
same thing has rdf:first arcs from it, they must be to nodes which
are RDF equivalent - are the same RDF node.</li>
<li>Lists are the same RDF node if they have the same the:first and
the same rdf:rest.</li>
</ol>

<p>This may seem obvious when you think of a list as a datatype.
Occasionally people express surprise that statements like the one
above which have a list as a subject but no information about it
disappear when loaded into an N3 store.</p>
<h2 id="numbers">Notes on Numbers</h2>
<p>The BNF syntax above describes the syntax for various literal
productions. These syntax strings identify values which are members
of various classes of number. The BNF productions should not be
confused with the relationship between number classes. In the
syntax, integer, rational and real productions are distinct. When
it comes to the values they represent, all integers are also
rational numbers, and all nationals are also real numbers.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between the rationals 1.0 and 1/1 and
the the integer 1. The semantics of rational numbers are true to normal
mathematical equality.</p>
<p>The issue of reals is more complicated, as any real literal is
necessary approximate. So while there is a real number which is
equal to the rationals 1 or 1/3, reals do not support this
comparison. (See XML Schema Datatypes)</p>
<h3 id="booleans">Boolean literals</h3>
<p>The words <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are boolean
literals.</p>
<h2 id="subsets">Appendix: N3 Subsets</h2>
<p>For various purposes it is useful to define limited subsets of
the language. These are defined in terms of N3 by grammar.</p>
<p><a href="/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples">NTriples</a> is an
<em>extremely</em> constrained language which uses hardly any
syntactic sugar at all: it is optimized for reading by scripts, and
comparing using text tools. It just allows one triple on each line.
It was designed for the RDF test suite parser reference output.</p>
<p class="issue">[The RDF test suite format is not committed to be
an exact subset of N3, and currently (2004) specified uses a
\uXXXX form for encoding unicode characters in URIs, in variance
with N3, and the IRI drafts which use %XX encoding of utf-8.
Currently this output option is a --n3=u flag in cwm].</p>

<p class="note"><a href=
"http://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/">Turtle</a>
is another subset, for only expressing RDF. It is like n3-rdf below
except that it does not have the path syntax.
It is a subejct of a searate document.
</p>
<p class="issue">
The fact that the turtle language is a subset of the N3 language 
has not been checked from the grammars.

<p>Grammars for N3 subsets are linked below.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Historical Notes</h2>
<h3 id="hist_numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p class="note">Whilst complex numbers (with integer, rational or
real parts) are a reasonable class to add, it is not seen as a
priority at the moment.</p>

<p class="note">The literal syntax for decimals as 1.0 as opposed
to double length reals as 1.0e0 or 1e0 was decided in coordination
with the DAWG working group in January 2006.</p>

<h3 id="hist_bool">Boolean truth values</h3>

<p class="note">They were added to Notation3 in 2006-02 in
discussion with the SPARQL language developers, the Data Access
Working Group. Note that no existing documents will have used a
naked true or false word, without a <code>@keyword</code> statement
which would make it clear that they were not to be treated as
keywords. Furthermore any old parser encountering true or false
naked or in a @keywords statement would throw an error,
so misunderstanding is avoided</p>

<h3 id="hist_mime">Mime Type History</h3>

<p class="note">[The type application/n3 was applied for in 2002 and again
in 2006.  The IETF-W3C liaison meeting established that the
mime type would be formally awarded when the N3 specification was
in a 'published' form. In the mean time, it should be used
 as part of the point of N3 is to be human readable,
and so the text tree is indicated. The application for text/rdf+n3
within the IANA registry is pending as of 2006-02 as IANA #5004.
While registration is pending, applications should use the proposed
type in anticipation of registration, <strong>not</strong> an x- type.]</p>

<p class="note">
In 2008-01, this specification was submitted as a W3C Team Submission.
Some discussion of the mime type occured, in hich the consesnsus appeared to
be that text/n3 was preferable to text/rdf+n3, and so that change was adopted.
</p>
<p class="note">
In 2008-01, there was some discussion also as to whether the encopding parameter
really was likely to be used in practical systems.
That general IETF architecture is outside the scope of the document.
