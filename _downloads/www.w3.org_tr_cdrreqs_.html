<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="approach" id="approach"></a>1.1 Approach</h3><p>The Compound Document Formats Working Group is producing
	recommendations on combining separate component languages
	(e.g. XML-based languages, elements and attributes from
	separate vocabularies), like XHTML, SVG, XForms, MathML, and
	SMIL, with a focus on user interface markups.  When combining
	user interface markups, specific problems have to be resolved
	that are not addressed by the individual markups
	specifications, such as the propagation of events across
	markups, the combination of rendering or the user interaction
	model with a combined document. The Compound Document Formats
	working group will address this type of problems.  This work
	is divided in phases and two technical solutions: combining
	by reference and by inclusion.</p><p>The group is addressing the semantics of combining markups,
	which goes beyond the mechanics and syntactical elements used
	to combine markups.  The semantic of combining markup is, to a
	large extent, specific to any two markups being combined. For
	example, including SVG markup in an XHTML document can be done
	in various ways and there is a need to define how the
	combination is done and what it means, especially with regards
	to issues mentioned above (such as event propagation, user
	interactions or rendering). Because defining the combined
	semantics is complex, because the group needs to deliver a
	test suite and specific conformance requirements (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/CDF/admin/charter">charter</a>)
	and because there is a growing request to support specific
	versions of specific markups, the group will initially produce
	a specification that mandates specific versions of specific
	markup profiles. However, as explained in the following
	section, the group will structure its specification work such
	that generic combination concepts and techniques are part of a
	framework specification so that they can be easily referenced
	and reused in other contexts, or in future specifications this
	group produces.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="phases-of-work" id="phases-of-work"></a>1.1.1 Phases of Work</h4><p>The phases of work lists a set of languages (with their
	  profiles) that are combined. As the languages differ by
	  their features and properties, different issues come up when
	  combining together different languages. Therefore, the phase
	  constrains the issues that are currently solved.</p><p>The standardization starts with a limited set of
	  languages. Once issues on these languages are solved, a next
	  larger package is started. The following phases contain more
	  languages and therefore, the corresponding recommendations
	  solve a wider variety of combination issues. </p><p>Each phase results in:</p><ul><li><p>a new version of the Compound Document Framework
	    specification</p></li><li><p>(at least) one specific Profile specification
	    that uses the corresponding Compound Document
	    Framework. Each Profile specification will include a list
	    of specific supported languages (and profiles thereof) and
	    also include any supplemental integration notes as
	    necessary beyond what is described in the
	    Framework.</p></li></ul></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="intro-by-reference" id="intro-by-reference"></a>1.1.2 By Reference</h4><p>The first technical solution for combining document
	  formats is combination by reference. This means that
	  documents using different languages (XML vocabularies) are linked
	  by a reference such as XLink references, XHTML &lt;img&gt;, &lt;object&gt;
	  and XForms instance src attributes.
	  This allows separate languages to work together,
	  but it allows implementations of the languages be
	  separated. </p><p>The standardized issues are for example, how events flow
	  in multi-document environment, how different documents are
	  accessed by the scripts, and how different languages should
	  cooperate in drawing to the screen (or other media).</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="intro-by-inclusion" id="intro-by-inclusion"></a>1.1.3 By Inclusion</h4><p>
			A subsequent phase will address compound documents by inclusion, which is 
			combining more than one namespace vocabulary within the same document. For 
			example, a compound document with XHTML as the enclosing root schema which 
			contains nested XForms namespace elements, and SVG namespace elements, 
			and XML Events elements all in the same document. A compound document by 
			inclusion, may also contain reference to other separate documents, and 
			therefore may be a combination of inclusion and reference.
		</p><p>
			The standardization issues that will be addressed in the Compound 
			Documents by Inclusion Recommendation are how different namespace 
			vocabulary implementations will interact within the same document, and how 
			compound documents by inclusion should be loaded and processed by browser 
			user agents.

<h3><a name="rich_multimedia_content_definition" id="rich_multimedia_content_definition"></a>1.2 Definition of Rich Multimedia Content</h3><p>
	  This specification addresses UI languages in order to
	  facilitate <b>rich multimedia content</b>, which can
	  include the following characteristics.
	</p><ul><li><p>
	    Graphically rich content, possibly including animated
	    background image.</p></li><li><p>
	    
	      Content author/provider has exact control of the
	      presentation, including fonts, layout, color, etc.
	    
	    </p></li><li><p>
	    
	      Layout adaptation: layout can be based upon device
	      characteristics - screen size, color depth, resolution,
	      orientation.</p></li><li><p>
	    
	      Navigation (forward/backwards tab, up/down/left/right,
	      accesskey, pointer, voice), graphical menus,
	      interactivity and animations.
	    
	    </p></li><li><p>
	    
	      Graphical menu systems where items have an animated
	      action when focused on.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	    
	      Portable user interface.
	    
	    </p></li><li><p>
	    
	      Presentation can be customized to reflect a brand or
	      user's personality.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	  
	    Skinnable user interface: the ability to use animations
	    and interactivity as a user interface "skin" or template
	    around other content.

<h3><a name="relationships-with-other" id="relationships-with-other"></a>1.3 Relationships With Other Technologies</h3><p>There are many technologies that allow combining different
	languages. Most extensible languages provide this
	feature. The combining technologies and issues can be divided
	in two categories. The first category is how the combining
	is described. The second category is how the semantics of
	combining is understood. Each language specifies the first
	category. The combining recommendations try to solve the
	second ones.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-html-xhtml" id="relationships-html-xhtml"></a>1.3.1 HTML and XHTML</h4><p>HTML has an &lt;object&gt; element. This element can be used to
	  combine by reference.  The &lt;object&gt; element provides a way to
	  link to external documents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-svg" id="relationships-svg"></a>1.3.2 SVG</h4><p>SVG has a &lt;foreignObject&gt; element. This element can be used
	  to combine by reference. The &lt;foreignObject&gt; element
	  provides a way to link to external documents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-smil" id="relationships-smil"></a>1.3.3 SMIL</h4><p>SMIL technologies are closely related to combining by
	  reference. SMIL provides mechanisms (e.g., &lt;animation&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;
	  and &lt;video&gt; elements) to combine content and synchronize them in time.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-xlink" id="relationships-xlink"></a>1.3.4 XLink</h4><p>Xlink specifies a generic reusable vocabulary for links
	  in XML documents. An XLink may be specified on an arbitrary
	  element in such a way that an XLink enabled processor will
	  be able to understand the linking semantics of said element. A variety of
	  linking behaviors (embedding, hyperlinking, etc.) may be further
	  described using additional linking metadata.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-xinclude" id="relationships-xinclude"></a>1.3.5 XInclude</h4><p>XInclude specifies how to combine different infosets
	  together. This approach may be used for combination by
	  inclusion.</p><p>After the XInclude markup is processed, the WG's produced
	  recommendations will specify the semantics on how the application
	  should understand the compound document.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-soap-attachments" id="relationships-soap-attachments"></a>1.3.6 SOAP Attachments and Optimization Technologies</h4><p>SOAP Attachments provide a way to divide documents into
	  several pieces for more efficient serialization and subsequent
	  recombination. For the WG's produced recommendations,
	  SOAP Attachments are similar in scope to the XInclude technology,
	  the combining technology operates and provides semantic
	  information on top of these serialization issues.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-open-document" id="relationships-open-document"></a>1.3.7 OASIS's Open Document Format</h4><p>The OASIS effort is targeted at office productivity
	  applications, such as word processors, spreadsheets or
	  presentation authoring tools. The work is focused on
	  representing the full information contained in documents
	  that are created and edited with such tools in an
	  interoperable manner. On the other hand, the CDF effort is
	  focused on combining formats for web publication and has a
	  lot of focus on user agent environment, and runtime
	  behavior. For example, the CDF Working Group efforts will focus on issues
	  such as the runtime interaction model for documents
	  including components from different XML formats. This is not
	  addressed by the Open Document Format specification. The
	  Open Document Format, on the other hand, specifies an office
	  application compatible style model, page layouts, index
	  generations, text fields, table formulas which the CDF
	  specifications will not address.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationships-forms" id="relationships-forms"></a>1.3.8 XForms</h4><p>XForms is a schema designed to split documents into three
	  parts: the XForms model, the instance data, and the user
	  interface.  It provides a mechanism for expressing the data
	  and intent of a form and allowing browser/renderers the
	  flexibility to present the information most suitable for the
	  device currently rendering the form.  XForms supports
	  compound document by inclusion by design since it is not a
	  free-standing document type, and was always meant to be
	  enclosed by a root document.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="relationship-xhtml-voice" id="relationship-xhtml-voice"></a>1.3.9 XHTML + Voice</h4><p>The XHTML+Voice profile is designed for Web clients that
	  support visual and spoken interaction. The XHTML+Voice
	  profile brings spoken interaction to standard web content by
	  integrating a set of mature web technologies such as XHTML
	  and XML Events with XML vocabularies developed as part of
	  the W3C Speech Interface Framework. The profile includes
	  voice modules that support speech synthesis, speech dialogs,
	  command and control, speech grammars, and the ability to
	  attach Voice handlers for responding to specific DOM events,
	  thereby re-using the event model familiar to web
	  developers. Voice interaction features are integrated
	  directly with XHTML and CSS, and can consequently be used
	  directly within XHTML content. The definition of the
	  XHMTL+Voice profile is a compound document profile.</p></div></div><div class="div2">

<h2><a name="use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>2 Use Cases</h2><p>The W3C and other bodies have created multiple XML syntaxes
      for various purposes, such as XHTML for on-line document
      viewing, SVG for 2D vector graphics or SMIL for multi-media
      synchronization. While there has been a lot of interest for
      these individual solutions, there has been a growing demand for
      a solution that would let end-users use them together to define
      a single piece of content. The individual markups as those just
      mentioned have great features, but these features become even
      more compelling when combined. For example, being able to
      display scalable 2D images in XHTML pages provides the ability
      to define pages which can be printed with high
      quality. Similarly, using SVG images in an XHTML table provides
      an easy way to layout SVG images in a table.</p><p>There is a demand for letting content creators combine
      markups so as to create richer documents, containing multi-media
      information: text, graphics, audio and video. For that reason,
      the main use case for the CDF activity is the definition of rich
      multimedia content, as defined in <a href="#rich_multimedia_content_definition"><b>1.2 Definition of Rich Multimedia Content</b></a>.</p><div class="div2">

<h3><a name="specific-use-cases" id="specific-use-cases"></a>2.6 Specific Use Cases</h3><p>Whereas the use cases outlined above are general in nature, the following use cases go into more detail and specifically describe some of the implementation issues that require the use of compound document technology.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="usecase-sync-of-html-content" id="usecase-sync-of-html-content"></a>2.6.1 Synchronization of HTML content with audio visual content:</h4><p>The description of an auction item on an auction service (a Web page)
	  includes a short video clip that describes the item. Lets
	  assume the user needs to watch the video clip in-full for
	  legal reasons before he is allowed to place a bid for this
	  item by typing the amount in an entry field and pressing the
	  "Place Bid" button on the same Web page.</p><p>User starts play-back of the video by selecting a button
	  on the page. This raises an event that starts playback of
	  the embedded video object. Once the video has ended the
	  embedded video object raises another event. This event
	  causes the "Place Bid" to become selectable in the HTML
	  page.</p><p>This use case includes several functionalities which are
	  not possible in HTML and the &lt;object&gt; element today: </p><ul><li><p>starting and stopping playback of an embedded video (or audio) in response to interaction with another HTML element</p></li><li><p>an embedded object generating an event that causes an update to the including HTML page (possibly with the help of JavaScript) without reloading this page</p></li></ul></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="usecase-animated-svg-icons" id="usecase-animated-svg-icons"></a>2.6.2 Animated SVG icons in HTML menu</h4><p>An HTML page includes a menu for the user to select
	  between different Web applications. Each menu item is a
	  single &lt;a&gt; element. Each anchor value consists of an SVG
	  graphics and a rich text label. Each SVG graphics must
	    scale to fit the same size rectangular bounding box
	    (position and size defined by the containing HTML+CSS
	    document), aspect ratio must be maintained when
	    scaling. Example:</p>

	  These are general requirements for the Compound Documents by
	  Reference (CDR) specification.
	</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-exploitexisting" id="reqmt-exploitexisting"></a>3.1.1 CDR MUST exploit existing specifications, favoring W3C
	  specifications wherever possible and limit the definition of new
	  markup unless absolutely required for integration purposes</h4><p>It is not the role of the Working Group to invent new
	  markup, but rather to specify rules by which existing markup
	  formats are combined.
	  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-richmultimedia" id="reqmt-richmultimedia"></a>3.1.2 CDR MUST provide the ability for content developers to describe
	  or author rich media content define Rich Multimedia Content</h4><p>Rich Multimedia Content is defined in <a href="#rich_multimedia_content_definition"><b>1.2 Definition of Rich Multimedia Content</b></a>.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-baseset" id="reqmt-baseset"></a>3.1.3 CDR MUST specify a base set of formats, corresponding
	  profiles and versions</h4><p>Conformant implementations MUST support this base set.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-otherformats" id="reqmt-otherformats"></a>3.1.4 Each CDR profile and version MUST specify, which formats can be referenced</h4><p>Each CDR profile has a root document and one or more
	  child documents. The CDR profile has to specify both the
	  root document and the possible child documents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-elementused" id="reqmt-elementused"></a>3.1.5 CDR MUST specify, for each format, the element used to
    reference other formats, if any.</h4><p>For example, the CDR
    specification will specify that the XHTML &lt;object&gt; element is to
    be used for formats included in XHTML, and will specify the
    usage of this element to include other formats.</p><p>It may be necessary to transfer some parameters declaratively 
    to a child document. Each CDR profile MAY specify a list of pre-defined 
    parameters/values for the &lt;object&gt; element. For instance, for CDR WP1, 
    there could be these kind of parameters/values:</p>

<h4><a name="reqmt-genericintegrationtechniques" id="reqmt-genericintegrationtechniques"></a>3.1.6 CDR MUST specify generic integration techniques</h4><p>These are techniques that will be applicable
    beyond the set of formats, versions and profiles required by the
    CDR spec.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-temporalsync" id="reqmt-temporalsync"></a>3.1.7 
      CDR MUST support temporal synchronization of dynamic content
      coming from multiple references, possibly with multiple
      references to the same source.</h4><p>Support the synchronization of multiple instances of
    dynamic content, such as animations, audio and video, within a
    single compound document.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-eventscrossnamespace" id="reqmt-eventscrossnamespace"></a>3.1.8 CDR MUST support event mechanisms that cross namespace boundaries</h4><p>Define consistent rules that specify how events pass to
    components. In particular, provide rules that define the behavior
    when events are passed across namespace boundaries.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-scriptability" id="reqmt-scriptability"></a>3.1.9 CDR MUST support scriptability</h4><p>Compound documents have to support scripting languages. The scripts
    have to be able to access and modify the elements of both root and child
    documents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-nestinglevel" id="reqmt-nestinglevel"></a>3.1.10 CDR MUST say the allowed nesting level of referencing</h4><p>Each CDR profile must define, whether there are restrictions to
  number of nesting levels. For example, whether a referenced SVG can
  itself reference another XHTML content.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-scriptingbetweencomponents" id="reqmt-scriptingbetweencomponents"></a>3.1.11 CDR MUST explain how scripting interacts between components and the parent document</h4><p>CDR profile documents must explain what kind of access, if any,
    scripts have between the parent and child documents and
    vice-versa.  Can a script in a child document access its parent's
    DOM, and if so, how?  Can a script in a parent document access a
    child's DOM?  If there is access, the mechanism must be described.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-focus" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-focus"></a>3.1.12 CDR profiles MUST specify how event propagation works
    across namespace boundaries.</h4><p>CDF profile documents must explain how, if at all, events get
    propagated from parent to child documents and vice-versa.  Do
    events from a parent document get propagated to the children
    documents?  Do events from a child document get propagated to the
    parent document?</p><p>For example, if an XHTML document references an SVG document,
    what is the event propagation model when the user activates an SVG
    element? Do events bubble from a child document to the referencing
    parent document? Does event capture happen from the root of the
    referenced document or does it happen from the root of the
    referencing document? This event propagation model MUST be
    consistent with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events">DOM Level 3 event
    model</a>.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-links" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-links"></a>3.1.13 CDR profiles MUST specify how focus traversal works with
    referenced documents.</h4><p>For example, when an XHTML document references an SVG document,
    what is the relation between the XHTML document's focus traversal
    and the SVG document's focus traversal. How does the SVG document
    get focus and how does the focus traversal starts in the SVG
    document? How does it end?
</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-link-activation" id="reqmt-link-activation"></a>3.1.14 CDR profiles MUST specify how link activation work with
    referenced document.</h4><p>A referenced object may be wrapped with a XHTML anchor.
    A referenced object may contain it's own embedded links.
    A referenced object may be wrapped with a XHTML anchor and 
    contain it's own embedded links.</p><p>In addition, a referenced object may draw it's own visual 
    feedback for focus activation and/or mouse-over.</p><p>CDR must specify all these cases, since they may require different 
    handling, depending on the type of user interaction: pointing device 
    or joystick operation.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-animations" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-animations"></a>3.1.15 CDR profiles MUST specify triggering of animations across namespaces.</h4><p>For example, if an XHTML document references an SVG document,
    the profile MUST specify how an SVG animation can be triggered by
    an XHTML event target.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-crossnamespace-fragmentIDs" id="reqmt-crossnamespace-fragmentIDs"></a>3.1.16 CDR MUST support fragment identifiers in cross-namespace
    interaction</h4><p>In CDR, child documents within a parent document are referenced
    with URI references.  This URI reference must support also
    so-called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#fragid">fragment
    identifiers</a>. Each fragment identifier is passed to the
    component or plug-in that displays the child document, when the
    documents are loaded. The handling of the fragment identifiers
    depends on the MIME type of the child document.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-addingeventhandlers" id="reqmt-addingeventhandlers"></a>3.1.17 CDR profiles SHOULD provide a method for adding event
    handlers using declarative markup for the formats it uses</h4><p>Event handlers contain instructions on how to react to certain
    event. These can be written either using a scripting language or a
    declarative (i.e., markup) language. The CDR specification should
    provide a method to add event handlers both to parent and child
    documents. If a CDR profile contains a markup language that
    supports declarative event handlers then the CDR profile should
    also support event handlers defined using markup.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-accessibility" id="reqmt-accessibility"></a>3.1.18 CDR documents MUST cater for accessibility requirements</h4><p>All CDR profiles must take accessibility requirements in
    consideration. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web
    Accessibility Initiative</a> has defined Web Accessibility
    Guidelines, which must be used when CDR profiles are developed. In
    addition, markup language specific accessibility guidelines have
    been defined in Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines document. A CDR profile must support all the techniques
    that are supported by the markup language modules included in
    it. The same applies for the authoring tool accessibility
    guidelines and the user agent accessibility guidelines.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-dynamicupdating" id="reqmt-dynamicupdating"></a>3.1.19 CDR documents MUST support dynamic updating</h4><p>Dynamic documents can be manipulated by scripts, etc. The user
    interaction can fire events, which are caught by event
    handlers. The event handlers can then manipulate the elements via
    the DOM interface. These changes are then displayed to the
    user. CDR documents must support dynamic updating across different
    parent and child documents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-transport" id="reqmt-transport"></a>3.1.20 CDR must define its integration into the Web
    Architecture. It must include delivery over HTTP and should also
    strive to be transport independent</h4><p>CDR profile documents must describe how they integrate into the
    Web Architecture, particularly in the areas of media types and
    transfer/transport protocols.  It must be described how this works
    with HTTP as well as other protocols typically used to transfer
    Web content (e.g., RTP).</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-compression" id="reqmt-compression"></a>3.1.21 CDR MUST NOT prevent compression of the data</h4><p>For efficiency, user agents and other renderers must support
    served content that is compressed in whole or part.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-unified-key-handling-across-CD" id="reqmt-unified-key-handling-across-CD"></a>3.1.22 CDR MUST define the way soft-keys and accesskeys are handled across document components</h4><p>
      For instance, what happens when there is a conflict between 2 accesskeys 
      which have the same value but are supposed to trigger different actions
      in the parent and in the child documents.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-fonts" id="reqmt-fonts"></a>3.1.23 CDR User Agents MUST provide a default font for use by all components</h4><p>Standalone components or renderers, such as SVGT engines, do not 
    always provide a default system font.</p><p>A CDR User Agent, however, must at least provide one default system 
    font to all components, such as browsers, SVG engines and other renderers.</p><p>The CDR specification cannot mandate any particular font, nor font 
    technology. But it mandates the availability of 'a' default font, so 
    that content providers can print text in any component or render as 
    simply as this can be done in XHTML.</p><p>The default system font may be bitmap based, antialiased or a 
    vector font. Ideally, the same default system font should be used for 
    all components.</p>
<h5><a name="code-reqmt-fonts" id="code-reqmt-fonts"></a>The following SVG sample markup MUST generate visible text.</h5><table class="scrap" summary="Scrap"><tbody><tr><td><pre>&lt;svg ...&gt;
     &lt;text x="20" y="20" font-size="normal" fill="#000"&gt;Sample Text&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-serversideadaptation" id="reqmt-serversideadaptation"></a>3.1.24 CDR MUST NOT prevent server-side adaptation</h4><p>Some animations could be too heavy for some terminals - or
    could be too 'unsophisticated' for others.</p><p>Server side adaptation must therefore be possible in order to
    support less capable devices. For example, it should be possible
    for a server to determine the SVG capabilities of the device (such
    as the rendering and animation capabilities.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-limitedbandwidth" id="reqmt-limitedbandwidth"></a>3.1.25 CDR MUST support limited bandwidth networks and limited
    capability devices</h4><p>Small footprint and mobile devices often are connected to
    mobile networks, characterized by comparatively low bandwidth
    and/or high connection latency. Additionally, mobile networks may
    charge users for data downloaded. It is therefore desirable to
    ensure that this bandwidth is used optimally.</p><p>Authoring tools and/or systems serving CDR documents must be
    able to use techniques to reduce size of materials transmitted and
    the latency involved.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-document-confirmance-criteria" id="reqmt-document-confirmance-criteria"></a>3.1.26 CDR Profiles MUST define clear document conformance criteria</h4><p>CDR Profile specifications must define what kinds of documents are conformant and non-conformant.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-useragent-conformance-criteria" id="reqmt-useragent-conformance-criteria"></a>3.1.27 CDR Profiles MUST define clear user agent conformance criteria</h4><p>CDR Profile specifications must define conformance rules for user agents.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-currentLoadingStatus" id="reqmt-currentLoadingStatus"></a>3.1.28 CDR Profiles SHOULD provide a way to know the current loading status of a
referenced component</h4><p>Sometimes, one or several medias are needed before the end-user can
interact with a RichMedia application : for instance, a list of small
audio clips must be downloaded in an interactive game before the
end-user can start playing. Or some small audio clips must be downloaded
before the application can provide speech instructions in a navigation
system ("turn left", "turn right", ...). As a result, CDR should explain
a way to know whether a referenced component is currently loading, has
successfully been loaded or failed to be loaded and launch appropriate
actions accordingly.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-packaging-static" id="reqmt-packaging-static"></a>3.1.29 CDR MUST provide a solution for packaging of self-contained, static content</h4><p>Packaging is needed in order to support optimization of the
    number of individual fetch operations that are required to
    construct the final user experience on the device.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-packaging-streamed" id="reqmt-packaging-streamed"></a>3.1.30 CDR MAY provide a solution for packaging of streamed content</h4><p>In addition to <a href="#reqmt-packaging-static"><b>3.1.29 CDR MUST provide a solution for packaging of self-contained, static content</b></a>,
    packaging of streams may be studied in order to accomodate audio
    and video content.</p></div></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="rich_multimedia_content_requirements" id="rich_multimedia_content_requirements"></a>3.2 CDR Profile 1 Requirements (Rich Multimedia Content)</h3><p>The language profile combining XHTML, CSS and SVG according to the
  CDR rules is referred to in this document as CDR Profile 1. This
  section identifies the requirements specific for the use of XHTML as
  the parent CDR Profile 1 document and SVG Tiny as the child
  document.  This profile supports presentation of rich multimedia
  content, as defined in <a href="#rich_multimedia_content_definition"><b>1.2 Definition of Rich Multimedia Content</b></a>, and many of the
  requirements herein are related to this definition.  XHTML and SVG
  have been chosen as the first profile for CDR according to analysis
  of existing specifications and their applicability to rich
  multimedia content: <a href="#relationships-with-other"><b>1.3 Relationships With Other Technologies</b></a></p><p>These requirements should be considered as additional
  requirements to the applicable requirements specified in other
  sections of the document.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-userinteractionmodel" id="reqmt-userinteractionmodel"></a>3.2.1 CDR Profile 1 MUST specify a user interaction model</h4><p>CDR Profile 1 must support a clear user interaction model between
   	components (event/focus management). Interactivity between
   	components will help to provide a seamless and compelling user
   	experience of documents which combine XHTML and media
   	elements.
   	</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-useragentidentifies" id="reqmt-useragentidentifies"></a>3.2.2 CDR Profile 1 MUST explain how a User Agent is able to identify a CDR Profile 1 document</h4><p>CDR Profile 1 content (that is, content which confirms to a language
    profile built using the CDR Profile 1 specification) will be unambiguously
    identified as conforming to that language profile.</p><p>Content creators and viewer implementations will both better be
    able to meet the conformance requirements of the CDR
    specifications if such content can be unambiguously identified.
    Use of a specific mime type will furthermore (through the use of
    accept headers) allow servers to perform a simple check on whether
    a suitable client is available.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-scalablegraphics" id="reqmt-scalablegraphics"></a>3.2.3 CDR Profile 1 MUST support 2D scalable vector graphics</h4><p>
      2D Scalable vector graphics are required in order to easily deploy the
      same user interface onto multiple devices with different screen
      sizes / shapes and resolutions.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-audio" id="reqmt-audio"></a>3.2.4 CDR Profile 1 MUST support audio</h4><p>User agents must support the ability to play audio while rendering content.  For example, a rendered document may choose to play music while the document is displayed.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-video" id="reqmt-video"></a>3.2.5 CDR Profile 1 SHOULD support video</h4><p>User agents should support the ability to play video while rendering content.  For example, a rendered document may choose to play a video clip while the document is displayed.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-layouts" id="reqmt-layouts"></a>3.2.6 CDR Profile 1 MUST support grid, flow, overlapping layouts</h4><p>In order to create rich content document, content authors need the 
ability to position and layout information items or user interface 
components. This is crucial authoring feature which also allows content 
to adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratio. Layout is a 
complement to the scalable nature to formats such as SVG. In CDR Profile 
1, grid and flow layouts MUST be supported. Overlapping layout, i.e., 
the ability to layout component that overlap completely or partially, 
MUST also be supported.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-transparency" id="reqmt-transparency"></a>3.2.7 CDR Profile 1 MUST support SVG backgrounds</h4><p>A CDR user agent MUST support static SVG background images and
    MAY support animated or scripted SVG background images. Authors
    however should not assume that the latter functionality will be
    available.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-transparency2" id="reqmt-transparency2"></a>3.2.8 CDR Profile 1 MAY support XHTML backgrounds</h4><p>A CDR user agent MAY support compositing above an XHTML document defined as a background image.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-identificationofmarkup" id="reqmt-identificationofmarkup"></a>3.2.9 CDR Profile 1 MUST support identification of markup and versions in CDF documents</h4><p>CDR Profile 1 must provide a mechanism for uniquely identifying the
    markups and versions used in a particular CDF documents. Ensure
    that this information can be used in content negotiation.

    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-scalablediagrams" id="reqmt-scalablediagrams"></a>3.2.10 CDR Profile 1 MUST support scalable diagrams that can be animated
  	and can cause link traversal</h4><p>An example of usage is the implementation of buttons which render
	their own visual feedback (animated buttons for
	navigation). These will provide a scalable alternative to the
	use of images as the source of links that can be
	traversed. These should be allowed to contain animation, but
	not rich interaction.
   	</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-xhtmlplussvg" id="reqmt-xhtmlplussvg"></a>3.2.11 CDR Profile 1 MUST define how to reference SVGT graphics and resources
    from an XHTML document</h4><p>A compound document by reference is defined as one root or
    parent document that makes a reference to separate child
    documents.  Compound Document profiles that include SVG Tiny as
    referenced documents from XHTML must define how to reference the
    separate SVG Tiny graphics and resources.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-advertisingsvg" id="reqmt-advertisingsvg"></a>3.2.12 CDR Profile 1 MUST support advertising the specific supported versions
    of formats and capabilities in headers</h4><p>When a user agent makes a request for content, it must identify
    the content types it can support.  This is done by specifying the
    mime-type, version, and profile information, for each supported
    type of content, in the request.  Using HTTP, this can be done by
    either using the HTTP ACCEPTS header or the UAProf.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-XHTMLasroot" id="reqmt-XHTMLasroot"></a>3.2.13 CDR Profile 1 MUST support XHTML as a root/host language</h4><p>However it is not necessarily the only root hosting language.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-XHTMLobjectelement" id="reqmt-XHTMLobjectelement"></a>3.2.14 The XHTML &lt;object&gt; element MUST be used for referring to
    other formats from XHTML</h4><p>It is desirable to achieve the goal of embedding media and
    other objects into XHTML documents by using the existing
    &lt;object&gt; element rather than extending XHTML. The XHTML
    &lt;object&gt; element will be the method by which XML document types
    will be referenced from XHTML documents.
    </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-xhtmlsvginteractionmodel" id="reqmt-xhtmlsvginteractionmodel"></a>3.2.15 CDR Profile 1 MUST define the interaction model for an SVG
   document referenced by an XHTML document</h4><p>To ensure interoperability, it is important that the CDR Profile 1 
specification defines the interaction model for SVG documents referenced 
by XHTML documents. For example, the interaction model must define if 
and how interaction with an SVG document requires activation, or if 
activation is optional, how activation is controlled. By the same token, 
the interaction model should define the precedence rules between the SVG 
content and the referencing XHTML document, for example regarding 
hyperlinking: if an XHTML &lt;object&gt; is enclosed in an &lt;a&gt; element and the
&lt;object&gt; references an SVG document which itself displays anchors, what 
is the behavior when clicking over one of the anchors in the SVG element?</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-animatedSVGicons" id="reqmt-animatedSVGicons"></a>3.2.16 CDR Profile 1 MUST define for animated SVG icons to act like HTML
   images (no need for interactivity, links, zoom and pan)</h4><p>
   When used as background images, it is complex and most often irrelevant to
   provide interaction, such as zooming, panning, linking and mouse events
   processing, with the SVG graphics. However, animation makes senses in that
   it can provide decorative value.
   </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-focusevents" id="reqmt-focusevents"></a>3.2.17 CDR Profile 1 MUST define a way for events to trigger SVG
   animation</h4><p>This is required in order to support pleasing
   button animation on select and activate events, such as focus
   events, beyond the current "on/off" capability in
   CSS</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-realestatenegotiation" id="reqmt-realestatenegotiation"></a>3.2.18 CDR Profile 1 MUST define the process for real-estate negotiation
   between an XHTML document and a referenced SVG document</h4><p>CDR Profile 1 will provide comprehensive, mandatory rules that
   specify how document components from different XML vocabularies are
   scaled when they occur within other components
   (right-sizing). Support the ability for relative size measures
   to be used by authors. Ensure that rules define the behavior
   when fixed and relative sized components are used together
   within a single document. Ensure that the rules define the
   behavior associated with areas of the containing component
   not filled by the contained component. Thus, it will be
   possible to create truly screen size-independent content.
   </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-leftovers" id="reqmt-leftovers"></a>3.2.19 CDR Profile 1 MUST define handling of leftover SVG area</h4><p>Rendering SVG content in a fixed-sized area often
results in visible areas outside of the SVG viewbox.  How these areas
are filled must be defined.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-systemfontsupport" id="reqmt-systemfontsupport"></a>3.2.20 CDR Profile 1 MUST define system font support in SVG</h4><p>SVGT does not mandate system fonts, but in the context of a
      user agent, highly optimized system fonts are available. On many
      devices (when executed in the context of a user agent), highly
      optimized fonts are available. </p><p>It is therefore necessary to make highly optimized terminal
      fonts (used by the user agent) available to SVG as system fonts and
      to support the ability for common font sets to be used
      throughout the combined document. In particular, platform fonts
      should be able to be used if supported, with support font fall-back
      mechanisms to provide defaults in the event that chosen fonts
      are unavailable. The SVG &lt;text&gt; element should always display
      something as long as it is within the viewport.</p><p>Related to CDR requirement: <a href="#reqmt-fonts"><b>3.1.23 CDR User Agents MUST provide a default font for use by all components</b></a>.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-temportal-start-and-stop" id="reqmt-temportal-start-and-stop"></a>3.2.21 CDR Profile 1 SHOULD provide temporal synchronization with dynamic media</h4><p>The Profile should be able to synchronize events with the start and end of playback of dynamic media objects, such as a video or audio stream.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-stop-and-start-media" id="reqmt-stop-and-start-media"></a>3.2.22 CDR Profile 1 MAY provide functionality to stop and start media objects</h4><p>The profile may include mechanisms to start playback of dynamic content (from the start of a stream) and to stop playback (with automatic rewind).</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-unifiedrendering" id="reqmt-unifiedrendering"></a>3.2.23 CDR Profile 1 MUST support a unified rendering and processing model</h4><p>Ensure that rendering is consistent across all components of a
    CDR Profile 1 document. In particular, ensure that there are suitable
    rules that define how z-ordering applies between different
    components which may overlay one another. Also ensure that there
    are rules that define how transparency is handled when components
    overlay one another. CSS z-ordering may provide a mechanism for
    controlling this.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-animationOnLoad" id="reqmt-animationOnLoad"></a>3.2.24 CDR Profile 1 SHOULD provide a way to play an animation while some
referenced components of the Combined Document are loading</h4><p>The profile should define mechanisms allowing to play an animation while
one or several parts of the combined document are loading. For instance,
this can be a progress bar informing the end-user about the loading
progress or an advertising which plays while some audio/video content is
being fetched.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="reqmt-audiomixing" id="reqmt-audiomixing"></a>3.2.25 CDR Profile 1 MUST specify the behavior of audio mixing</h4><p>CDR Profile 1 must specify how user agents behave when multiple
    audio streams are played simultaneously within a compound
    document.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="back"><div class="div1">
