    <section id="abstract" class="introductory"><h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p> The Web borrows familiar concepts from physical media (e.g.,
	the notion of a "page") and overlays them on top of a
	networked infrastructure (the Internet) and a digital
	presentation medium (browser software). This is a convenient
	abstraction, but when social or legal concepts and frameworks
	relating documents, publishing and speech are applied to the
	Web, the analogies can be misleading, for example, publishing a page on
	the Web is fundamentally different from printing and
	distributing a page in a magazine or book.
      </p>
      <p> Communication is often subject to governance: legislation,
      legal opinion, regulation, convention and contract; these are
      ways in which society looks to enforce norms, for example,
      around copyright, censorship, and privacy.  But there
      is often a mismatch between governance intended to apply to the
      Web (usually based on the analogy with physical media) and the
      technology and architecture used to create it.
      </p>
   <!--   <p> One particular mismatch is the way in which publication can
	happen without any judgment or review by Web subsystems, with
	the process based on actions of end-users. For example, web
	intermediaries such as proxies, archives, search engines, or
	by content transformation services might be part of the
	publication pipeline. For the most part, such sub-systems
	cannot exercise the kinds of judgment needed, even if required
	to by governance.
      </p>  -->
      <p> This document is intended to inform future social and legal
	discussions about the architecture of the Web: the ways in which the
	Web's technical facilities operate to store, publish and
	retrieve information, and by providing definitions for
	terminology as used within the Web's technical community. Specifically,
	this document has the following goals:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>Clarify that linking - providing the location of some content -
	    is different in intention from including - embedding content developed
	    elsewhere within your own - and should be treated differently by the law.</li>
	  <li>Intermediaries, such as proxies and caches, and more controversially, search
	    engines and agggregators that merely refer to or collect content developed
	    elsewhere, should be treated differently than websites that create orginal content.</li>
	  <li>In many cases, websites put legal restrictions on how the material they make
	    available may be linked or reused.  Such restrictions can be better enforced by
	    using mechanisms provided by the web rather than by legal terms of use.</li>
	</ul>

    <section id="whywewroteit">
	     <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Why We Wrote This Document</h2>
<p>In recent months there have been several legal actions against individuals and organizations for making material available that is illegal or seditious material and may have been copyrighted.  We argue in  
<a href="#Including" class="sectionRef">section 4.3 Including</a> that the manner in which the material is made available is important and should be taken into consideration.  Similarly, as we explain in 
<a href="#Caching" class="sectionRef">section 4.2 Caching and Relaying</a> there are several kinds of intermediaries that store and/or integrate material from other sources.  The role of these intermediaries is quite different from websites that provide original content and the laws should (and in some cases do) distinguish between them.</p>
<p>
As the Web has worked its way into the fabric of our lives and access to the Internet is likened to free speech as a fundamental right, it is also increasingly subject to governance.  By governance we mean the general idea of societal controls, whether by legislative, regulatory, court order, contractual, or other means. Unfortunately, a number of problems arise when dealing with
 governance of the Internet. </p>
<ul>
<li>Regulations often do not match the technology. We use analogies to talk about technology; for example, we talk about "publishing a page", but the actual process of putting up a web page is very different from physical publishing by making and distributing printed paper. So a rule "It's okay to read this page, but you can't make a copy of it" doesn't acknowledge that, in order to read a page, the bits that make the page must necessarily be copied to the reader's computer.</li>
<li>Different goals conflict. Law enforcement might require that a site owner keep records of everyone who posts information, in order to be able to track down those who post illegal or defamatory material, while, at the same time, privacy regulation might insist that the same site owner not keep such records.</li>
<li>The Internet is global, but governance is local. The jurisdiction of law, regulation and social values are geographically based, but the Internet has no simple boundaries. Yet values, regulation, and laws from different jurisdictions are inconsistent, and often conflicting.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
The goal of this document is to clarify technology.  If it informs policy-makers and thus helps make better policies it will have succeeded in its goals.  A secondary goal is to point out that many restrictions on the use of Web material that are commonly written into Terms and Conditions are better implemented by technology.   For example, if a Website does not want other sites linking to specific pages it is more effective not to provide URIs for those pages rather than to include this restriction in the Terms and Conditions.

    <section id="introduction">
      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">2. </span>Introduction</h2>
      <p> The act of viewing a web page is a complex interaction
	between a user's browser and any number of web servers. Unlike
	reading a book, viewing a web page involves copying the data
	held on the servers onto the user's computer, if only
	temporarily. Logic encoded within the page may cause more
	copying to take place,
	perhaps from other servers.  The combined material may be displayed or otherwise
	used within the original page often without the user's
	explicit knowledge or consent. For an end user, it is usually
	impossible to tell whether a given image or video displayed
	within a page originates from the server the page comes from
	or from some other location.
      </p>
      <p> In addition to browsers and webservers, many other kinds of servers live on the Web.
	Proxy servers and services that combine and repackage data
	from other sources may also retain copies of this
	material. These intermediary services may transform, translate
	or rewrite some of the material that passes through them, to
	enhance the user's experience of the web page or for their own
	purposes.
        Still other services on the web, such as search engines and
	archives, make copies of content as a matter of course. This
	is, in part, to facilitate the indexing necessary for their
	operation, and in part to 
	provide value to their users and to the original
	authors of the web page.  These intermediaries, we argue, should be treated
	differently by the law based on how much control they have over the underlying material
	and how they process it.
      </p>
  <!--    <p>These are a few of the many ways in which the web is used by 
	different kinds of entities for their own ends. 
        When different entities interact, there are often
	conflicting goals [[TUSSLE]]. This brings about the need for policy
        because managing these conflicts (or
	"tussles") is crucial to the harmonious development of the
	Web.  See, for example, the kerfuffle regarding the DoNotTrack initiative: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/technology/do-not-track-movement-is-drawing-advertisers-fire.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper">Do Not Track? Advertisers Say  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/technology/do-not-track-movement-is-drawing-advertisers-fire.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper">Do Not Track? Advertisers Say 'Don't Tread on Us'</a>.This document explores some some of the implications of
	those tussles specifically with reference to the the web
        architecture of publishing and linking.
      </p> -->
	<p>
	  Examples of the kind of legal questions that have arisen related to material that originates on other sites include:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Is it unlawful to <em>link to</em> a page that contains

	<h3><span class="secno">2.1 </span>Background</h3>
	<p> Many content publishers seek to
	control the use of their content on the Web. In some cases,
	they employ means that do not take into account the
	Web's true architecture, and do not use the technical
	mechanisms available to them. A few illustrative examples are
	provided below.
	</p>
	<p> Licenses that describe how material may be copied and
	  altered by others tend not to distinguish between a proxy
	  compressing a web page to make it load faster and someone
	  editing and republishing the page on their own website. To
	  illustrate,
	  the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/legalcode">
	  Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs</a> defines the terms
	  (emphasis added):
	</p>
	<blockquote class="example">
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Adaptation</dt> <dd>means a work based upon the Work,
	or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as
	a <strong>translation, adaptation, derivative work</strong>,
	arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or
	artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
	cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
	Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
	form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
	work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
	Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance
	of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
	phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
	with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
	Adaptation for the purpose of this
	License.</dd>

	    <dt>Distribute</dt> <dd>means to make available to the
	      public the original and copies of the Work
	      through <strong>sale or other transfer of
	      ownership</strong>.</dd>

	    <dt>Reproduce</dt> <dd>means to <strong>make copies of the
	      Work</strong> by any means including without limitation
	      by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation
	      and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage
	      of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form
	      or other electronic medium.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  Consider, now, the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
	  <li> Does using the automatic Google Translate service
	      (which can be invoked automatically within Chrome) count
	      as an "adaptation" of a Work, given that it's a
	      translation, or is it only non-automated translations
	      that would count?</li>
	  <li> When a document is made available on a website, the
	      original owner still retains their copy, it is
	      not <em>transferred</em>, so does this count as
	      "distribution"?</li>
	  <li> If someone accesses a document released under this
	      license on the web, it has to be copied onto their
	      machine in order to be displayed; does this mean anyone
	      accessing the document "reproduces" it? </li>
	</ul>

	<p> Terms and Conditions statements on websites also list
	  acceptable and unacceptable behavior on a site, with any
	  browsing on the site implicitly indicating acceptance of the
	  terms. These generally do not take into account the
	  behavior of proxies. For instance, one standard set of
	  Terms and Conditions includes:
	</p>
	<blockquote class="example" cite="http://www.website-law.co.uk/templates/termsandconditions.php">
	  <p>
	    You may <strong>view, download for caching purposes
	    only</strong>, and print pages from the website for your
	    own personal use, subject to the restrictions set out
	    below and elsewhere in these terms of use.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    You must not:
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    (a) republish material from this website (including republication on another website);
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    (b) sell, rent or sub-license material from the website;
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    (c) show any material from the website in public;
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    (d) reproduce, duplicate, copy or otherwise exploit material on our website for a commercial purpose;
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    (e) <strong>edit or otherwise modify any material on the website</strong>; or
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    (f) redistribute material from this website except for content specifically and expressly made available for redistribution (such as our newsletter)
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p> It is not possible to view material on the web without it
	  being downloaded onto your computer, so forbidding
	  downloading except for caching purposes essentially means
	  that people cannot view the page. In addition, many proxies
	  automatically transform the documents that pass through
	  them, for example to compress them so that they take up less
	  bandwidth for mobile consumption or to introduce
	  advertisments into pages that are accessed free of charge.
	  Should this be  prohibited?
	</p>
	<p>
	  Limits placed on the use of a website often include
	  limitations on automatic indexing of the website, without
	  exceptions for search engines that make the website
	  discoverable or archives that ensure its longevity. For
	  example, the set of terms and conditions quoted
	  above goes on to say:
	</p>
	<blockquote class="example" cite="http://www.website-law.co.uk/templates/termsandconditions.php">
          <!-- where does this URL appear -->
	  <p>
	    You must not conduct any systematic or automated data
	    collection activities (including without limitation
	    scraping, data mining, data extraction and data
	    harvesting) on or in relation to our website without our
	    express written consent.
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  Search engines rely on systematic data collection from
	  websites in order to provide users with accurate search
	  results, and archives do so in order to retain websites for
	  posterity. So, these terms and conditions, if adhered to
	  strictly, put the website out of the reach of search engines
	  and hence makes it undiscoverable; surely this is not in the
	  best interest of the website. Another problem is that
	  automated agents (webcrawlers, spiders, robots) that
	  gather information from the web are unable to read these
	  terms and conditions; the only things they understand are
	  the technical signals that a website provides about what is
	  permitted.  See more on this below.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As another example, the terms and conditions
	  for <a href="http://www.gsig.com/" rel="nofollow">gsig.com</a> include:
	</p>
	<blockquote class="example" cite="http://www.gsig.com/websiteterms.pdf">
	  <p>
	    Use of Materials: Upon your agreement to the Terms, GSI
	  grants you the right to view the site and to download
	  materials from this site for your personal, non-commercial
	  use.  You are not authorized to use the materials for any
	  other purpose.  If you do download or otherwise reproduce
	  the materials from this Site, you must reproduce all of
	  GSI?s proprietary markings, such as copyright and trademark
	  notices, in the same form and manner as the original.
	  </p>
	  <p>...</p>
	  <p>
	    You may not use any "deep-link", "page-scrape"?, "robot",
	  "spider" or any other automatic device, program, algorithm
	  or methodology or any similar or equivalent manual process
	  to access, acquire, copy or monitor any portion of the Site
	  or any of its content, or in any way reproduce or circumvent
	  the navigational structure or presentation of the Site.
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  It would be simpler and more effective for the site to use technical means
	  for controlling what webcrawlers, spiders or robots
	  access on the site, namely a <code>robots.txt</code> file
	  which is a set of machine processable instructions
	  instructing automated web agents what thay can and cannot
	  do.  They could also exempt automated web agents from the
	  Terms and Conditions as discussed below.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Many sites have a linking policy that limits what links can
	  be made to the site from other sites. These conditions are
	  not backed up through relatively simple technical mechanisms
	  that would prevent such links from being made. For example,
	  the website
	  at <a href="http://www.quotec.co.uk/">quotec.co.uk</a> has a
	  linking policy that includes:
	</p>
	<blockquote class="example" cite="http://www.quotec.co.uk/linking-policy">
	  <p>
	    Links pointing to this website should not be misleading.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Appropriate link text should be always be used.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    From time to time we may update the URL structure of our
	    website, and unless we agree in writing otherwise, all links
	    should point to http://www.quotec.co.uk.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    You must not use our logo to link to this website (or
	  otherwise) without our express written permission.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    You must not link to this website using any inline linking technique.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    You must not frame the content of this website or use any
	  similar technology in relation to the content of this
	  website.
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Technically it is straightforward to prevent linking to pages that the website
	  does not want others to link to:  you simply do not give these pages URLs or make the
	  URLs undiscoverable.  This is likely to be more
	  effective than asking people to read and adhere to the Terms and Conditions.
	  Several techniques for controlling linking and inclusion are discussed in 
	  <a href="#Techniques" class="sectionRef">section 6. Techniques</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Legislation that governs the possession and distribution of
	  unlawful material (such as child pornography, information
	  that is under copyright or material that is legally
	  suppressed through
	  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order">gag
	  order</a>) needs to exempt certain types of services,
	  such as caching or hosting, as it would be impractical for
	  such services to police all the material
	  that passes through their servers. This does not, however, always
	  happen and intermediaries are often held accountable for material that
	  did not originate with them and have no control over.  
	  An example of good legislation
	  that does exempt intermediaries the UK is
	  the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/13">Coroners
	  and Justice Act 2009 Schedule 13</a>; from the Explanatory
	  Notes (emphasis added):
	</p>
	<blockquote class="example" cite="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/notes/division/5/1/2/2/7">
	  <p>
	    Paragraphs 3 to 5 of [Schedule 13] provide exemptions for
	    internet service providers from the offence of possession of
	    prohibited images of children in limited circumstances, such
	    as <strong>where they are acting as mere conduits for such
	      material or are storing it as caches or hosts</strong>.

      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">4. </span>Publishing</h2>
      <p> The concept of publishing on the web has evolved as the
	    web's ecosystem has enlarged and diversified, and as the
	    capabilities of browsers and the web standards that they
	    implement have developed. There is no single definition of
	    what publishing on the web means. Instead, there are a
	    number of activities that could be viewed as publication
	    or distribution in a legal sense. This section describes
	    some of these activities and how they work.</p>
      <section id="hosting">
	<h3><span class="secno">4.1 </span>Hosting</h3>
	<p>
	  The basic form of publication on the web is hosting. A
	  server <dfn title="host" id="dfn-host-1">hosts</dfn> a file if it stores the
	  file on disk or generates the file from data that it stores,
	  and that file did not (to the server's knowledge) originate
	  elsewhere on the web.
	</p>
	<figure id="fig-accessing-hosted-pages">
	  <figcaption>Fig. <span class="figno">1</span> <span class="fig-title">Accessing hosted pages</span></figcaption>
	  <p>A browser makes a request to a hosting server for a
	  file. The hosting server responds with the content of that
	  file, which the browser stores in a local cache and displays
	  to the user.</p>
	  <p>
	    <img alt="Diagram showing a browser accessing web content
	    from a hosting server and creating a copy of it within its
	    cache." src="img/hosting.png">
	  </p>
	</figure>
	<p>
	  The presence of data on a server does not necessarily mean
	  that the organisation that owns and maintains the server has
	  an awareness of the presence of the data or its
	  content. Many websites are hosted on shared hardware that is
	  owned by a <dfn id="dfn-service-provider-1">service provider</dfn> that stores and
	  serves data at the direction
	  of <dfn title="controller" id="dfn-controller-1">controlling</dfn> individuals and
	  organisations which determine the data they provide on the
	  site. Because of this, multiple servers may host the same
	  file at different locations. 
	</p>
<!--	<figure>
	  <figcaption>Uploading files to a server</figcaption>
	  <p>A controller uploads a file to a hosting server, which is then accessed by a browser.</p>
	  <p>
	    <img alt="Diagram showing a controller uploading data to a server" src="img/uploading.png" />
	  </p>
	</figure> -->
	<p>
	  There are many different types of service provider. Some 
	  exercise practically no control over the software and data
	  that they host, merely providing a base platform on which
	  code can run. Others may focus on particular types of
	  content, such as images (e.g. Flickr), videos (e.g. YouTube)
	  or messages (e.g. Twitter). Also, there may be many service
	  providers involved in the publication of a particular file
	  on the web: some providing hardware, others providing
	  different kinds of publishing support.
	</p>
<!--	<figure>
	  <figcaption>Transforming files on a server</figcaption>
	  <p>A controller uploads a file to a hosting server, which is then automatically transformed into a different format which is accessed by a browser.</p>
	  <p>
	    <img alt="Diagram showing a controller uploading data to a server that is then transformed" src="img/transforming.png" />
	  </p>
	</figure> -->
	<p>
	  Some <a class="internalDFN" title="service provider" href="#dfn-service-provider-1">service
	  providers</a> automatically
	  perform <dfn title="transformation" id="dfn-transformation">transformations</dfn> on
	  material that they host, as a service, such as converting to
	  alternative formats, clipping or resizing, or marking up
	  text. When they sign up to a service, <a class="internalDFN" title="controller" href="#dfn-controller-1">controllers</a> explicitly or implicitly
	  enter into an agreement with the service provider that
	  grants them a license to perform transformations on the
	  material which they upload.
	</p>
<!--		<div class="practice">

				<span class="practicelab">Transformation of Unlawful Material</span>

	<p>
	  <a class="internalDFN" title="service provider" href="#dfn-service-provider-1">Service
	  providers</a> that host particular types of material often
	  employ automatic filters to prevent the publication of
	  unlawful material, but it is impossible for a service
	  provider to detect and filter out everything that might be
	  unlawful.
				</p>
	<p>
	  To add to the complexity of this area, it is possible for
	  each of the following to be in different jurisdictions:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>the individual or organisation who <a class="internalDFN" title="controller" href="#dfn-controller-1">controls</a> the data</li>

	  <li>the physical servers that <a class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-host-1">host</a> the data</li>
	</ul>
<p>and be controlled by different laws and conventions.</p>

      <section id="Caching">
	<h3><span class="secno">4.2 </span>Caching and Relaying</h3>
	<p>
	  Some servers provide access to files that are hosted
	  elsewhere on the web: on an <dfn id="dfn-origin-server-1">origin server</dfn> that
	  holds the original version of the file. These files might be
	  stored on the server and provided again at a later time
	  (a <dfn id="dfn-caching-proxy-1">caching proxy</dfn> in this document), or might
	  simply pass through the server in response to a request
	  (a <dfn id="dfn-relaying-server">relaying server</dfn> in this document).

	  </p><figure id="fig-accessing-web-content-via-a-caching-proxy">
	    <figcaption>Fig. <span class="figno">2</span> <span class="fig-title">Accessing web content via a caching proxy</span></figcaption>

	    <p>A browser requests web content from a server; the
	      caching poxy responds with content that it has
	      fetched from an origin server.</p>
	    <p>
	      <img alt="Diagram showing a caching proxy passing on to
			a browser a copy of content from elsewhere" src="img/caching.png">
	    </p>
	  </figure>

	<p> It is often impossible to tell whether a server is
	  providing a stored response or whether it has made a new
	  request to the origin server and is serving the results of
	  that request. Servers commonly store the results of some
	  requests and not others, acting as a caching proxy some of the
	  time and as a relaying server the rest.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In both cases, the file the caching or relaying server
	  provides might be different from the original web content
	  that was accessed from the origin server. For example:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Links within HTML content might be rewritten so that they
	    point to content that is also served by the caching proxy.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Javascript and CSS files might be combined and compressed to
	    provide speedier access.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Banners might be added within an HTML page to highlight that
	    the page is a copy of an original from somewhere else.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Content might be compressed or converted to different formats.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Wholly new content might be created that bring together
	    information from multiple different sources.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Caching and relaying servers are extremely useful on the
	  web. There are four main types of caching and relaying
	  servers discussed here: proxies, <a class="internalDFN" title="archiving server" href="#dfn-archiving-server">archives</a>, search engines and
	  reusers. The distinctions between them are summarised in the

	  <h4>Proxies</h4>
	  <p>
	    A <dfn>proxy</dfn> is an application that sits in between
	    a server (such as a website) and a client (such as a
	    browser). On the web, <dfn title="caching proxy">caching
	    proxies</dfn> are often used to speed up users' experience
	    of the web by caching pages and other web content onto the
	    proxy server so that they can be accessed faster. Some
	    proxies, particularly those used by mobile operators,
	    perform other actions on the content that passes through
	    them, such as rewriting or merging Javascript to make it
	    faster to access.
	  </p>

    <div class="practice">
      <p>
	<span class="practicelab">Controlling Proxy Behavior</span>
      </p>
      <p class="practicedesc">Proxies should comply with instructions
      from origin servers that describe whether pages may be copied
      and transformed, but will only be able to comply with those that
      are machine-readable.</p>
    </div>
	  <p>
	    Proxies come in four general flavors:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <dfn title="forward proxy">Forward proxies</dfn> serve a
	      given community, such as a company. The browsers of the
	      members of that community are set up to use the proxy,
	      and whenever they fetch web content, the request is
	      routed through the proxy. If the proxy already has a
	      cached copy of the web content, it returns that copy
	      rather than forwarding the request on to the origin
	      server. If many people within the community are
	      requesting the same pages, this can speed up their
	      access and lower the bandwidth use of the community. The
	      proxy can also be used to prevent access to unsuitable
	      sites and to carry out virus checking on the content.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <dfn title="reverse proxy">Reverse proxies</dfn> sit in
	      front of a (private) server and cache responses from
	      that server. This can reduce the load on the server and
	      speed up responses, which is particularly important when
	      the response to a request takes time to compute. An
	      extreme version of this is a <dfn>content-delivery
	      network</dfn> (<abbr title="content-delivery
	      network">CDN</abbr>) which operates a set of proxies
	      and directs requests to the nearest of these, saving
	      transmission time as well as processing time.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <dfn title="gateway">Gateways</dfn> are proxies which
	      usually do not cache the result of a request: they
	      simply pass on the request to an origin server and pass
	      the response back. Gateways may be used to prevent
	      access to particular parts of the web, or to bypass
	      those blocks. For example, a gateway may be set up that
	      prevents access for users in a particular country to
	      particular websites; another gateway might be set up, at
	      a non-blocked location, that enables people within that
	      country to access those websites by mapping requests on
	      that gateway to requests on the blocked website.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <dfn title="transforming proxy">Transforming
	      proxies</dfn> are proxies which transform the Web
	      content being delivered through them to address issues
	      such as presentation issues, or in order to speed up
	      access to those documents. For example, transforming
              proxies are used to compress content. [reference to
              Mobile Web
	      Best Practices working group work
	      on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ct-guidelines/">best
	      practices for transforming proxies</a>].
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <div class="note">Split browsers (such as Opera Mini and
	  Amazon Silk) where some software components execute on a
	  server and some software components execute on a client
	  device are not discussed further in this document. Since, in
	  these cases, the client and the server are tightly coupled,
	  they could be considered to be a single User Agent rather
	  than a client and a proxy.</div>

	  <p>
	    The use of a forward proxy, gateway or transforming proxy
	    may be configured either on an individual machine or
	    transparently for a particular network. Users may have no
	    idea that their requests are channelled through a given
	    proxy, or they may have configured their set-up to use the
	    proxy.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Reverse proxies appear to be normal servers to users: it
	    is impossible for a user to tell that their request is
	    actually passed on to a completely different origin
	    server, or where that server is. This is intentional as
	    the origin server in this case is a private one.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To improve performance, some proxies, particularly Content
	    Distribution Networks (CDNs), may pre-fetch web content
	    that a page includes, since that content is likely to be
	    requested by the browser soon after the page is
	    viewed. Thus, although generally the contents of a proxy's
	    cache will be determined by the requests that users of
	    that proxy have made, the proxy might also in some cases
	    contain content that no one has ever requested.

	  <p>
	    Archives are often run by institutions that have a legal
	    mandate and responsibility to keep a historical record,
	    such as
	    a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_deposit">legal
	    deposit</a>. Although their primary purpose is long term
	    record-keeping, they often make this material available
	    online as well. They might restrict access to the data for
	    a period of time after it is collected, for security or
	    privacy reasons, and may respond to legally-backed removal
	    requests. Users might use archives for research, but also
	    to access information that has otherwise been removed from
	    the Web.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When they are made available to the public, archived pages
	    are often distinguishable by end users from the original
	    page using banners placed within the page or having the
	    original page appear within a frame. The links (both to
	    other pages and to embedded web content such as images)
	    are usually rewritten so that when the user interacts with
	    the page, they are taken to the version of the linked web
	    content at the same point in time. "Dark archives" do not
	    make their content available to the public.

-->
	  <p>
	    Search engines are mostly interested in indexing web
      content and providing links to them rather than in the content

      store metadata about the page, derived from the information in
      the page and other information on the web, such as what other
      pages link to it.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Search engines play an important role in the web by enabling people to find information, including that which would otherwise be lost or is temporarily unavailable. When a user views a stored page from a search engine, it is usually obvious both that the search engine is involved (from the URI of the page and from banners or framing), that the content originally came from somewhere else, and where it came from. The links within the page are not usually rewritten.

	    Reusers that do not change the information from the origin

	  <p>
	    Since reused information is, by design, seamlessly

	  Aliases do not involve any of the information from
	  the <a class="internalDFN">origin server</a> passing through

	  Although it is preferable to only have one URI for a particular piece of web content, redirections are a useful mechanism for managing change on the web. They are used within websites when the structure of the website changes, or between websites when a new website is created that supersedes the first, or to <a class="internalDFN" title="archive">archived</a> information when a host no longer wants to provide access to a file itself.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Redirections are also used to provide other services. <dfn title="link shortener">Link shorteners</dfn> provide a short URI that is then redirected to the original URI, and are useful in situations where space is limited such as in print or on Twitter or where the original URL feels long and unwieldy.

      <p class="practicedesc">When aliasing is used to provide a shorter alternative URI to a resource, best practice is to use a domain which is associated with the domain of the destination URI. This allows the end user to know more about where the link will send them and will potentially enhance the longevity of these aliases. Examples are nytim.es and bbc.in.</p>

	<p>
	  When aliasing is used, users may not be aware about the
	  eventual target of a link, or the involvement of an aliasing
	  server, both of which are important. Shortened links, for
	  example, hide the target location behind a URI that often
	  has no visible relationship to the eventual destination of
	  the page. Some implementations of link tracking do not
	  change the original destination of the link (such that the
	  status bar on a browser shows the eventual target of the
	  page) but instead use the <code>onclick</code> event to
	  direct the user to the aliasing server.</p>

	<p>
	  Following a redirection, browsers change the address bar to
	  the new location, but this is often the only indication, and
	  the user may miss it and be unaware of the redirection.

	  A web page written in HTML may include other web content,

	  HTML. The HTML in a web page refers to this external web
	  content using markup. For example,
	  an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element uses
	  the <code>src</code> attribute to refer to an image which
	  should be shown within the page. Material that is included

	<p>
	  HTML supports several different mechanisms
	  for <dfn title="include" id="dfn-include-1">including</dfn> external web content
	  in a web page but they all work in essentially the
	  same way. When a user navigates to a web page,
	  the browser automatically fetches all the included web
	  content into its local cache and executes them or displays
	  them within the page.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Inclusion is different from hosting, copying or
	  disseminating a file because the information is never stored
	  on, nor passes through, the server that hosts the web page
	  doing the including. As such, although the included
	  web content is an essential component of the page to make it
	  appear and function as a whole, the server of the web page
	  does not have control over content which may change
	  without its knowledge.
	</p>
<!--
	<p>
	  Users may not be aware that included content is used within
	  a page at all. When included content is embedded within the
	  page such that it is visible to a user, it may not be clear
	  that an image or video is from a third-party website rather
	  than the website that they are visiting unless this is
	  explicitly indicated within the content of the page.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Web content that is included into a popular page may cause a
	  large number of requests to the server hosting the included
	  content.  This can be burdensome, and affect performance.
	  Publishers who intend their content to be reused in this
	  way, therefore, typically have terms and conditions that
	  apply to the reuse of those files and may to put in place
	  technical barriers to restrict it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As with normal links, included content may or may not have
	  the same origin as the page that includes it. Content such
	  as images and scripts that are included within the web page
	  may be from any site. However, browsers implement
	  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy"><dfn>same-origin
	  policy</dfn></a> which generally means that third-party
	  content cannot be fetched and processed by scripts running
	  on the page, for example
	  through <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/"
	  title="XMLHttpRequests">XMLHttpRequests</a>
	  [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]].  However, these scripts <em>can</em>
	  write markup into the page which causes the inclusion of
	  such resources.

	<section id="InclusionChains">
	  <h4><span class="secno">4.3.1 </span>Inclusion Chains</h4>
	  <p>
	    When scripts or HTML are included into web pages, the
	    included content may itself include other content (which
	    may include still more and so on). The author of the
	    original web page can choose what content it
	    wants to include, but does not have control over
	    the choice of the subsequently included content.

	    The publishers of included content might change the
	    content at any time, possibly without warning. This has
	    been used to include third-party
	    images without permission, or to substitute the image with
	    something distasteful or to redirect to a link that
	    performed an unintended action on the user's behalf;
	    see <a href="http://www.jibble.org/myspace-hotlinking/" title="Preventing MySpace Hotlinking">Preventing MySpace

	  <h4><span class="secno">4.3.2 </span>Hidden Requests</h4>
	  <p>
	    Some of the web content that is used within a page may
	    be invisible to the user. An example is a hidden image
	    that is used for tracking purposes: each time a user
	    navigates to the page, the hidden image is requested; the
	    server uses the information from the request of the image
	    to build a picture of the visitors to the site.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This facility can be used for malicious
	    purposes. An <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element can point to
	    any URI (not just an image) and causes a GET request to
	    that URI. If a website has been constructed such that GET
	    requests cause an action to be carried out (such as
	    logging out of a website), a page that includes this
	    "image" will cause the action to take place.

	  A user can usually tell where a link is going to take them

	  overridden by <code>onclick</code> event handling that takes

	  Wikipedia, use icons to indicate whether a link is a
	  cross-origin link or whether it will take a user to a page on
	  the same server. The use of interstitial pages or dialog
	  boxes which warn the user they are about to leave the site
	  in question can obscure the eventual destination of the
	  link.

	  If the link is a cross-origin link (or even in some cases

	<section id="ControllingAccess">
	  <h3><span class="secno">6.1 </span>Controlling Access</h3>
	  <p>Publishers can control access to pages in several ways.  
	    In addition to not giving out URIs to these pages, they can control access  
            via the <code>Referer</code> HTTP header which indicates the last page
	    that was referenced.  If it was not a page on your own site, then you 
	    can redirect to your site's home page, for example. It is also possible 
	    to do this check in JavaScript, which can then be used to bring up a 
	    dialog to check whether the contractual terms have been read, to
	    confirm that the user is over 18, or to ask for a password.</p>
	  <p>
	    You can also use a cookie, for example, to start a session only when 
	    a page is accessed through a given gateway page and reject or provide an
	    alternative path for requests that don't have the cookie set.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <code>User-Agent</code> HTTP header which indicates the identity of the user agent 
	    making the request is particularly useful in preventing access from crawlers and 
	    search engines.  A <code>robots.txt</code> file on the website can be also used for the
	    same purpose.</p>
	    <p>
	      The domain name or IP address of the client making the
	      connection can also be used to prevent specific
	      reusers from accessing material.

	    As well as the techniques above, which can be used to

	  <p>
	    Websites can include a license that describes how the
	    information served by the website can be reused by others.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Just as with HTTP headers, robots.txt and sitemaps, there
	    can be no technical guarantees that <a class="internalDFN" title="crawler" href="#dfn-crawler-1">crawlers</a> will honor license
	    information within a site. However, to give well behaved
	    crawlers a chance of identifying the license under which a
	    page is published, websites should:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Indicate the license of a web page, an image or a video
	    using a mechanism whereby the license can be detected
	    automatically such as
	      <ul>
		<li>a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
		or <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element
		with <code>rel="license"</code></li>

		<li>microformats [MICROFORMATS], RDFa [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-RDFA-CORE">RDFA-CORE</a></cite>] or
		microdata [MICRODATA] with a common property such
		as <code>xhv:license</code> to indicate the license of
		included content./li&gt;
	      </li></ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>Ensure that the conditions of the license are machine-understandable by
	      <ul>

		<li>referencing a well-known license (such as a
		Creative Commons license) through its URI, or</li>

		<li>providing a machine-readable description of the
		license, for example using
		the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/ns">Creative
		Commons Rights Expression Language</a>.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	<h3><span class="secno">6.6 </span>How to Write Good Websites</h3>
	<p>
	  This section describes techniques that you should use
	  when operating a website that incorporates material from
	  other sources, whether by caching, transforming or simply
	  linking.
	</p>
	<section id="HonoringHeaders">
	  <h4><span class="secno">6.6.1 </span>Honoring Headers</h4>
	  <p>
	    As described in <a href="#ControllingCaching" class="sectionRef sec-ref">section 6.3 Controlling Caching</a>
	    and <a href="#ControllingProcessing" class="sectionRef sec-ref">section 6.4 Controlling Processing</a>, there are a number of HTTP
	    headers and other conventions that indicate how origin
	    servers intend other servers to treat the resources that
	    they publish. Servers that cache or reuse data from
	    origin servers should obey these headers.
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section id="AddingHeaders">
	  <h4><span class="secno">6.6.2 </span>Adding Headers</h4>
	  <p>
	    Proxies must use
	    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.45"><code>Via</code></a>
	    HTTP header when they handle requests to origin servers,
	    to indicate their involvement in the response to the
	    user's original request. Proxies which perform
	    transformations on content must include
	    a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.46"><code>Warning:
	    214 Transformation applied</code></a> HTTP header in the
	    response.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    These and other recommendations for proxies which perform
	    transformations are included in
	    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ct-guidelines/">Guidelines
	    for Web Content Transformation Proxies 1.0</a>.
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section id="attribution">
	  <h4><span class="secno">6.6.3 </span>Attribution</h4>
	  <p>
	    Many licenses require reusers of information to
	    provide attribution to the original source of the
	    material. This attribution must be human-readable, so that
	    users understand where the material came
	    from, and may also be computer-readable, which enables
	    automated tools to track the use of material on the web.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The wording and positioning of attribution is usually
	    dictated by the license under which the material is made
	    available. For example, if you use
	    the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.axialis.com/free/icons/">free icons
	    available from Axialis Software</a> their license includes:
	  </p>
	  <blockquote cite="http://www.axialis.com/free/icons/">
	    <p>If you use the icons in your website, you must add the following link on each page containing the icons (at the bottom of the page for example):</p>
	    <blockquote><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.axialis.com/free/icons">Icons</a> by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.axialis.com/">Axialis Team</a></blockquote>
	    <p>The HTML code for this link is:</p>
	    <pre>&lt;a href="http://www.axialis.com/free/icons"&gt;Icons&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.axialis.com"&gt;Axialis Team&lt;/a&gt;
	    </pre>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>
	    If there is no explicit guidance about the location of
	    attribution, it is recommended that attribution to
	    material from a third party appear as close to the actual
	    material as possible. Methods to make the attribution
	    machine-readable include:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>the use of the <code>cite</code> attribute on
	    the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element, where a
	    portion of a page is quoted within your own site</li>

	    <li>using
	    the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-source"><code>dc:source</code></a>
	    property with microformats, microdata or RDFa to indicate
	    the source of a portion of the page (identified through
	    an <code>id</code>)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    An example of clear attribution of material from another site is that of the BBC Wildlife Finder; the following screenshot shows the attribution within the page on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Pygmy_Three-toed_Sloth">Pygmy Three-toed Sloth</a>.
	  </p>
	  <figure id="fig-attributing-reused-content">
	    <figcaption>Fig. <span class="figno">6</span> <span class="fig-title">Attributing Reused Content</span></figcaption>
	    <p>
	      <img alt="A description of the pygmy three-toed sloth is
	    followed by an attribution that reads &quot;This entry is
	    from Wikipedia, the user-contributed encyclopedia. If you
	    find the content in the 'About' section factually
	    incorrect, defamatory or highly offensive you can edit

	<section id="LinkingTechniques">
	  <h4><span class="secno">6.6.4 </span>Linking</h4>
	  <p>
	    There are a number of practices around linking to third-party sites that can help users and automated agents understand the relationship between your website and the third parties. These include:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use <code>rel="nofollow"</code> for links where the
	    link is not meant to imply approval; these will not be
	    used by search engines when determining the relevance for
	    a page</li>

	    <li>Use <code>rel="external"</code> for links to
	    third-party web pages; this can be used as the basis of
	    styling, such as an image that indicates the user will be
	    taken to a separate site</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    There are a number of techniques that can be used to track
	    which links are followed from a website. Methods that
	    rewrite the links within a web page to point to an
	    interstitial ("you are leaving this website") page or
	    through a script can mislead the user and any automated
	    agents about the target of the link. It is better to use a
	    script to capture <code>onclick</code> or other events and
	    redirect the user at that point.

      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">7. </span>Conclusions</h2>

      <p>In conclusion, publishing on the Web is different from print
      publishing. This document has enumerated some of these
      differences, especially those relevant to licensing, attribution and
      copyright issues.</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Content is published on the Web via a variety of service
	providers, each of which holds copies which it may transform
	as part of its function.</li>

	<li>Key parts of Web architecture rely on servers (such as
	proxies and search engines) to maintain copies of information that
	originates in other locations.</li>

	<li>Users may not be aware of the origin of all content
	displayed within in a Web page.</li>

	<li>Web technologies can act autonomously to access and copy
	information without a user's express consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended practices include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Proxies and other intermediary servers and services should
	obey instructions provided by origin services, such as
	cache-control headers.</li>

	<li>Content publishers and website owners should use technical
	means to restrict access to content rather than relying on legal
	Terms and Conditions.</li>

	<li>As far as possible, use links to third-party material rather than
	  embedding their content within your own.<p></p>
