	Abstract
</h2>
<p>
	The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/charter" title="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/charter">mission</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/">W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group</a>, chartered from May 2010 through August 2011, has been &quot;to help increase global interoperability of library data on the Web, by bringing together people involved in Semantic Web activities &mdash; focusing on Linked Data &mdash; in the library community and beyond, building on existing initiatives, and identifying collaboration tracks for the future.&quot; In Linked Data, data is expressed using using standards such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF), which specifies relationships between things, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">Uniform Resource Identifiers</a> (URIs, or "Web addresses"). This final report of the Incubator Group examines how Semantic Web standards and Linked Data principles can be used to make the valuable information assets that library create and curate &mdash; resources such as bibliographic data, authorities, and concept schemes &mdash; more visible and re-usable outside of their original library context on the wider Web. 
</p>
<p>
	The Incubator Group began by eliciting reports on relevant activities from parties ranging from small, independent projects to national library initiatives. These use cases provided the starting point for the work summarized in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/XGR-lld-20111025/">main report</a>: an analysis of the benefits of library Linked Data; a discussion of current issues with regard to traditional library data, existing library Linked Data initiatives, and legal rights over library data; and recommendations for next steps.

<h1><span class="mw-headline">1 Introduction</span></h1>
<p>
	Selected use cases and case studies from the library community and related sectors are described in this document. These were gathered and analyzed by the W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group, based on submissions from different organizations and individuals. Cases have been grouped into eight topical clusters, which are described below. Selected use cases from each cluster have also been summarized. 
</p>
<a name="Motivation_and_method" id="Motivation_and_method"></a>
<h1><span class="mw-headline">2 Motivation and method </span></h1>
<p>
	As described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/charter" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/charter">group charter</a>, one of the main activities of the W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group was to gather use cases and case studies demonstrating successful implementation of Semantic Web technologies in libraries and related sectors. Outreach and dissemination initiatives were also gathered, along with innovative uses, which demonstrate the possibilities and benefits offered by the application of Linked Data technologies and methods in libraries. 
</p>
<p>
	The use cases presented in this report demonstrate the potential benefit of Linked Data technologies for the description of library resources and their context, and the value of sharing these descriptions among institutions and with the broader public. Description in this context primarily entails the creation or representation of relationships between resources. These relationships are defined by aligning similar entities or making existing relationships more explicit. New relationships are created either through machine processing (inferences, alignments, etc.) or manual efforts (tagging, cataloging). Those relationships can then be used to provide discovery through browse and search services, and to federate or aggregate materials from different sources. Aggregation is also a factor in data management. Linked Data technologies are used to improve global interoperability of library data through the re-use of metadata element sets and value vocabularies, the application of <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> for resources, and the development publishing services such as <abbr title="Advanced Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>. 
</p>
<a name="Use_cases_organization" id="Use_cases_organization"></a>
<h1><span class="mw-headline">3 Use cases organization </span></h1>
<p>
	The collected set of use cases, case studies, initiatives, and ideas is organized into eight clusters: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Bibliographic data </li>
	<li> Authority data </li>
	<li> Vocabulary alignment </li>
	<li> Archives and heterogeneous data </li>
	<li> Citations </li>
	<li> Digital objects </li>
	<li> Collections </li>
	<li> Social and new uses </li>
</ul>
<p>
	After collecting and reviewing the submitted cases for each cluster, group members extracted general scenarios out of these cases. The motivation behind these extracted use scenarios is to summarize and capture the main ideas from the set of original cases. The extracted use cases presented in this document cover the majority of topics and situations related to each cluster. 
</p>
<p>
	The following figure depicts the use case organization and the aforementioned extraction process:

</p>
<p>
	This document presents the extracted use cases (section 4) and then offers short summaries for each individual case (section 5). In order to provide more detailed information to the interested reader, cluster sections and case summaries are linked to the wiki pages the Incubator Group has used to gather and curate the original information.

<a name="Bibliographic_data_cluster" id="Bibliographic_data_cluster"></a>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">4.1 Bibliographic data cluster </span></h2>
<p>
	This cluster presents use cases related to bibliographic records. A bibliographic record can be understood as a set of data elements describing the content and characteristics of an information object produced for human consumption.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Metadata enhancement by users uploading documents</span></h4>
<p>
	End users can benefit from systems that make use of authority files expressed as Linked Data. If the user wants to include metadata about an author, the title of work, keywords, etc., the system can suggest possibilities retrieved from authority files, thesauri, or controlled vocabularies. The suggested value will be uniquely identified by its <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>. In this way, systems support precise retrieval, improve usability, and mitigate issues such as record duplication. 
</p>
<a name="Extended_search_results_based_on_authority_data" id="Extended_search_results_based_on_authority_data"></a>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Extended search results based on authority data</span></h4>
<p>
	Document repositories can improve their search functions by using authority records published as Linked Data. Authority records serve to bring together all forms of a name for authorized entity names. Systems that make use of linked authority records can recognize different forms of names and direct the end users to all the records associated with the authorized form of the searched entity such as its related bibliographic records. The search results are therefore more complete. Additionally, such systems could also suggest related terms as further potential search terms. 
</p>
<a name="Authority_data_aggregation" id="Authority_data_aggregation"></a>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Authority data aggregation</span></h4>
<p>
	By publishing authority data as Linked Data, each authority record is uniquely identified by its <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>. Systems and initiatives, such as VIAF, can then benefit from relating records that refer to the same entities but that offer different information. As done in <a href="#Vocabulary_alignment_cluster">vocabulary alignment cases</a>, they can create semantic links between the records. They can then publish them as clustered records with each cluster also identified by an <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>. Such an approach could benefit organizations aiming to link their authority records to other cluster contributors by providing a central place to look them up. From the end-user perspective this could result in having aggregated information coming from various organizations, thus enriching the user experience.

Because it is hard to predict what methods a searcher will use and what information will be useful, Linked Data would allow searchers to follow the paths provided by any data points in the archival metadata.

<p>
	The archive would like to gain greater visibility by linking from Web resources to its materials. It would do this by creating and exporting its metadata in Linked Data format, and by adding that data to the Linked Data cloud. This scenario is expected to facilitate the creation of semantic links between heterogeneous material from libraries, archives, and museums.

	The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) initiated a fundamental re-examination of bibliographic data to produce a framework that would provide a clear, precisely stated, and commonly shared understanding of what the bibliographic record aims to provide information about, and what one expects the record to achieve in terms of answering user needs. In addition, <abbr title="International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions">IFLA</abbr> aimed to recommend a basic level of functionality and basic data requirements for records created by national bibliographic agencies. Linked Data techniques would allow these data and the concepts and relationships between them to be described as an information graph.

The <acronym title="International Information System for the Agricultural Sciences and Technology">AGRIS</acronym> Linked Data strategy focuses on two objectives: to institute <acronym title="International Information System for the Agricultural Sciences and Technology">AGRIS</acronym> as a producer of Linked Data exploiting the semantic richness of the <acronym title="International Information System for the Agricultural Sciences and Technology">AGRIS</acronym> data by creating an open <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> dataset in agricultural sciences; and to expose it to other Web services that can consume and link to <acronym title="International Information System for the Agricultural Sciences and Technology">AGRIS</acronym> data.

<p>
	Academic organizations of varying sizes (research groups, university departments, scholarly societies, special interest groups, etc.) have a strong interest in maintaining awareness and quality of information in their domain, and in openly publishing this information to the broader academic community and to the general public. A Linked Data approach could provide the data with an open license which allows its re-use for such purposes, and support the <abbr title="Advanced Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>, data standards and client software that would lower the barrier to participation in information curation and sharing.

<p>
	Matching algorithms in the library domain need reference data, yet current access to such reference data is limited. The application of Linked Data to library records could help to develop automated matching algorithms for library records so that finally only one record exists for every single intellectual item.

<p>
	The addition of Linked Data applications to library information systems creates a challenge for system architects on how to adapt legacy systems to make use of new Linked Data applications.

<p>
	Libraries wish to convert legacy metadata to <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> triples for several reasons, including: taking advantage of systems and services which may emerge in the Semantic Web environment; encouraging increased usage of metadata and the corresponding resources; and contributing to the general sharing of metadata and the common good. The goal is to represent library legacy data as Linked Data, retaining as much data, utility and semantics as possible, as well as to enable its use in both traditional and innovative ways. To achieve this goal there is a need for appropriate vocabularies and element sets to be available as Linked Data as well as stable community-wide mappings for common legacy metadata formats to <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> classes and properties.

<p>
	The Open Library is a large bibliographic database (circa 25 million items) of metadata for books. Over one million ebooks are represented in the database, linked from the bibliographic data. The goal is to allow the user to link to the Open Library data with the least friction, e.g., to link to a specific work that then provides information about other manifestations of the same work that are available as a full text.

	The AuthorClaim registration service aims to link scholars with the records about the works that they have written, as recorded in a bibliographic database.The application contributes to the identification of authors. In the application scenario, document metadata records are classified by subject experts. Each expert makes a binary decision whether a document belongs to a category or not. The resulting document collection forms an issue of a subject report. Linked Data can be used to further generalize the basic application and encourage the re-use of the application's results.

<p>
	One of the main pillars of scientific information retrieval is authors' names. The inconsistency problem in author name forms has been around for many years, but its negative effect is increasing due to the great number of people publishing research studies and papers. IraLIS works to make authors aware of the need to always sign in the same way, to register name variants they have used and to create an IraLIS signature that allows a suitable and unconfused signature recognition. Linked Data technologies could help IraLIS by creating specific <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> for each author.

<p>
	Language Technology is applied in areas such as machine translation, automatic summarization, (Web) search or spell checking. To estimate the usefulness of library Linked Data for language technology, it is important to concentrate first on one specific use case. This will be named entity recognition (NER) in single and potentially across languages. A traditional approach towards NER is the application of a gazetteer, i.e., a dictionary with information about places, people, and institutions. This approach has the drawback that it is hard to keep the gazetteer up-to-date. Another problem is the sustainable creation of gazeteers across languages. Linked data could help to solve the two problems of NER ("keeping up to date" and "briding across languages").

	In some scientific disciplines there is a growing trend to make available supporting data alongside journal publication of research. These data can either be stored and curated by the journal, or in discipline-specific repositories where these exist. Currently, there is no de facto method for citing the data made available. Linked data can provide guidance on how to assign identifiers, how to link data, descriptions, publications, and contributors or authors through vocabularies. As a result, automated systems could be able to extract data to compute measures of credit and to allow the making of connections, particularly to the same person. Additionally, human users could be able to view descriptions of the data by navigating from publications, and then access the data.

	Libraries and other repositories store scientific research papers in journals, dissertations, reports, memoranda, and book chapters. Papers consist mainly of text, tables, and illustrations. Also, a limited number of pages is available for each paper. These constraints make it difficult to include original data, video, more and larger images, etc., in the paper. Enhanced publications aim to make it possible to include not only the paper but also the underlying data, models, algorithms, illustrative images, metadata sets, or post-publication data such as comments or rankings. The application of Linked Data to this scenario could help to create a collection of research material that belong together and create a logical whole in the research process, in order to make research comparable and more transparent.

	Digital text repositories produce, store, and deliver digital resources containing textual data with varying amounts and coverage of appropiate metadata. Essentially, such repositories, unlike most libraries, actually produce new Manifestations (in <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> terms), namely the digital editions of the texts they prepare. Ideally, digital text repositories would not have to define <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr> Work and Expression entities at all; they would be able to refer to those entities defined elsewhere. Linked Data could allow digital text repositories to harness large metadata- and authority-providers, as well as other data providers, to describe their holdings, by facilitating the tasks of discovery, selection, and semantic linkage.

<p>
	Libraries and other repositories store scientific research papers in journals, dissertations, reports, memoranda, and book chapters. Papers consist mainly of text, tables, and illustrations. Also, a limited number of pages is available for each paper. These constraints make it difficult to include original data, video, more and larger images, etc., into the paper. Enhanced publications aim to make it possible to include not only the paper but also the underlying data, models, algorithms, illustrative images, metadata sets, or post-publication data such as comments or rankings. The application of Linked Data to this scenario could help to create a collection for research material that belong together and create a logical whole in the research process, in order to make research comparable and more transparent.

<p>
	Editing Reports on New Academic Documents (Ernad) is essentially a piece of software implementing a protocol called the Altai paper. The aim of the design of Ernad was to help editors of a subject category to decide whether documents fit into the subject category or not. A running Ernad program powers the NEP: New Economics Papers service of the RePEc digital library. Linked Data technologies could help to provide a more general specification that generalized the process of a learning classification system that is heavily dynamic. Also, it could provide a basis for making a standardized representation of the output of the services so that it is easier to import them into related information services.

<p>
	The National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) is a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Library of Congress (LC), and state projects to provide enhanced access to United States newspapers published between 1836 and 1922. Chronicling America is a Web application that allows users to search and view more than 2.5 million digitized pages as well as consult a national newspaper directory of bibliographic and holdings information for 140,000 newspapers, to identify newspaper titles in all types of formats. Linked Data principles provided the foundation for the design of the Chronicling America identifier space. The goal was to enable interested parties to extract data out the Web application to use in their own environments. Specifically the Web application was designed to mint URLs for each newspaper title, issue, and page.

	The digital version of the Cartographic Collection of the National Library of Latvia (NLL) contains scans of historical maps from the 16th to the 18th century. Currently maps are presented as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> index pages pointing to PDFs of scanned maps. Index pages contain semi-structured textual information about these maps. Maps and other objects are given <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> so that they can be globally referenced. Map metadata can be made available as Linked Data by using <abbr title="RDF in Attributes">RDFa</abbr> or by using <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> 303 redirects to point to various representations of resources and their metadata.

<p>
	The 20th Century Press Archives of the German National Library of Economics (ZBW) is a large collection of newspaper clippings about persons, companies, subjects, and products, extending from 1826 to 2005, organized in thematic folders. For parts of the collections, metadata (like source and date of an article or name and location of a company) is available (solely in German). <abbr title="Open Archives Initiative &#65293; Object Reuse and Exchange">OAI-ORE</abbr> provides the backbone for organizing the large and deeply nested aggregations of data. On every level of aggregations, it provides access to the aggregated resources. Search results are represented as dynamically built ORE aggregations.

<p>
	The AuthorClaim registration service aims to link scholars with the records about the works that they have written, as recorded in a bibliographic database.The application contributes to the identification of authors. In the application scenario, document metadata records are classified by subject experts. Each expert makes a binary decision of a document belonging to a category or not. The resulting document collection forms an issue of a subject report. Linked data can be used to further generalize the basic application, and encourage the re-use of the applications' results.

<p>
	Collection-level description consists of metadata pertaining to a collection as a whole, in contrast to item-level description (manifestation description in terms of <abbr title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</abbr>) which pertains to the individual members of a collection. The definition and publication of such collection descriptions as Linked Data, coming from multiple and heterogeneous sources, and its linkage to other datasets (geo, universities, commodities, etc.) could provide a rich but diverse set of services that can be customized by service providers and end users.

	Academic organizations of varying sizes (research groups, university departments, scholarly societies, special interest groups, etc.) have a strong interest in maintaining awareness and quality of information in their domain, and in openly publishing this information to the broader academic community and to the general public. A Linked Data approach could be combined with an open license which allows its re-use for such purposes, and support the <abbr title="Advanced Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>, data standards, and client software to lower the barrier to participation in information curation and sharing.

<p>
	Finding a digital copy of an item can be complex. Availability and access to items varies based on library subscription holdings, geographic rights restrictions, and national copyright laws. Individuals may have rights to multiple library collections which are sometimes supplemented by personal subscriptions and personal memberships. Linked Data technologies could support making access to digital resources user-centric, rather than institution-centric: determining whether the user has access to an item, given her personal subscriptions and library privileges.

<p>
	Libraries are also resources in the Semantic Web sense of the term. They need to be identified by <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> just as books and authors are identified. The HBZ (Hochschulbibliothekszentrum des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen) has created a Linked Data set of library institution identifiers that can be used for linking in different Linked Data scenarios such as linkage of holdings data to bibliographic data or mobile applications based on geolocation that provide opening hours and information about the building or the library staff.

<p>
	A search for bibliographic resources in a union catalog may identify a specific physical manifestation that is exemplified by multiple items held in more than one collection. It is useful to determine which of these collections is the nearest to a specified location, for convenience and to shorten the time taken to obtain access to one of the items. Current practice in recording the locations of libraries and other information service organizations varies widely. Linked Data technologies could help to provide a standard and more structured way to navigate through the catalog to find specific items and their geolocation.

What is needed is a simple and easily replicable architecture to enable community data curation services of various sizes to develop and interoperate. A Linked Data approach could help in several ways, such as providing machine-readable licenses (e.g. to allow matching against various open licenses which allows different levels of re-use), and supporting appropriate <abbr title="Advanced Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>, data standards and client software that would lower the barriers to participation in information curation and sharing.

<p>
	Linked Data technology provides the means to cross-link bibliographical information with other related data. The <a href="http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/">Federal Environment Agency of Germany</a> (UBA) has a long tradition of knowledge organization combining library resources with many Web-based information systems that present observation data and results of analyses. Until now, the library and the data representations have been kept separate. Using Linked Data, their classification system &mdash; enhanced by a reference vocabulary which consists of a thesaurus, a gazetteer, and a chronicle &mdash; can be interlinked to library data. UBA plans to cross-link bibliographical information with related environmental observation data, and to link each with the reference vocabulary.

	In the scientific publication process, a print publication is placed in a separate context from the data and links that were in the researcher's information environment. Mendeley proposes to add context back to publications through crowd-sourced social and attention-based metadata as well as with algorithmic approaches to linking documents. These functions will make use of Linked Data and graph analysis of links (e.g. of readership, co-citation, etc.).

<p>
	The Open Library is a large bibliographic database (approximately 25 million items) with metadata for books and linked full-text for over one million digitized books. The system clusters different editions for the same work, and thus makes it easy to find a digitized edition for the work if one exists among the editions. Each property and entity in the database has a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, <abbr title="Advanced Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> provide export of entities (works, editions, and authors) in <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>/<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>.

<p>
	Library catalogs have limited success in ranking search results. Better ranking could be obtained if libraries could use circulation data gathered from many libraries to determine which item is the most popular.

<p>
	One of the key concerns of libraries is to make their data searchable through Web search engines. Yet library catalogs have been conceived as data silos. Libraries are aware that they need to make their data more accessible on the Web, both by adopting an architecture that is compatible with web crawling by bots, and by optimizing the available content so that search engines can process it efficiently. The Web's major actors have demonstrated an interest in the use of <abbr title="RDF in Attributes">RDFa</abbr> and other structured metadata formats to improve the presentation of data in results pages or other tools like social network pages. Adding such structured data to library online catalogs could increase the visibility and accessibility of their data.

<p>
	A mechanism similar to a Facebook "Like" button, the "Support this book" button would connect pages from library online catalogs and library related websites to the Gluejar catalog, where these "votes" indicate support for releasing a <abbr title="Creative Commons">CC</abbr>-licensed version of the book as an ebook.

<p>
	Current library catalogs allow users to search library holdings by keywords or catalog field values and to sort search results by some of these fields (e.g., a title and a year). They usually do not offer ranking of search results by relevancy to the user. Library online catalogs could provide users with recommendations or search rankings based on information available about item popularity and user activity. In this scenario, Linked Data could be used to connect social data representing ranking and recommendations to the search application.
