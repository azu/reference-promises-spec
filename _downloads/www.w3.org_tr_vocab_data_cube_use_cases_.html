	<section class="introductory" id="abstract"><h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>Many national, regional and local governments, as well as other
		organizations in- and outside of the public sector, collect numeric
		data and aggregate this data into statistics. There is a need to
		publish these statistics in a standardized, machine-readable way on
		the Web, so that they can be freely integrated and reused in consuming
		applications.</p>
	<p>
		In this document, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
			Government Linked Data Working Group</a> presents use cases and lessons
		supporting a recommendation of the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary [<cite><a href="#ref-QB-2013">QB-2013</a></cite>]. We describe case studies of

	<section id="introduction-1">
	<!--OddPage--><h2 id="introduction"><span class="secno">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
	The aim of this document is to present concrete use cases and lessons
	for a vocabulary to publish statistics as Linked Data. An earlier
	version of the Data Cube Vocabulary [<cite><a href="#ref-QB-2010">QB-2010</a></cite>] has existed for some time and has
	proven applicable in several deployments. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
		Government Linked Data Working Group</a> intends to transform the data
	cube vocabulary into a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Recommendation of the RDF Data Cube
	Vocabulary [<cite><a href="#ref-QB-2013">QB-2013</a></cite>]. In this
	document, we describe use cases that would benefit from using the
	vocabulary. In particular, we identify possible benefits and challenges
	in using such a vocabulary for representing statistics. Also, we derive
	lessons that can motivate future work on the vocabulary as well as
	associated tools or services complementing the vocabulary.

	<p>The rest of this document is structured as follows. We will
		first give a short introduction to modeling statistics. Then, we will
		describe use cases that have been derived from existing deployments or
		from feedback to the earlier version of the Data Cube Vocabulary. In
		particular, we describe possible benefits and challenges of use cases.
		Afterwards, we will describe lessons derived from the use cases.</p>

	<p>We use the term "Data Cube Vocabulary" throughout the document
		when referring to the vocabulary.</p>

	<p>In the following, we describe the challenge of authoring an RDF
		vocabulary for publishing statistics as Linked Data. Describing
		statistics — collected and aggregated numeric data — is challenging
		for the following reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Representing statistics requires more complex modeling as
			discussed by Martin Fowler [<cite><a href="#ref-FOWLER97">FOWLER97</a></cite>]:
			Recording a statistic simply as an attribute to an object (e.g., the
			fact that a person weighs 185 pounds) fails to represent important
			concepts such as quantity, measurement, and unit. Instead, a
			statistic is modeled as a distinguishable object, an observation.
		</li>
		<li>The object describes an observation of a value, e.g., a
			numeric value (e.g., 185) in the case of a measurement and a categorical
			value (e.g., "blood group A") in the case of a categorical observation.</li>
		<li>To allow correct interpretation of the value, the observation
			needs to be further described by "dimensions" such as the specific
			phenomenon, e.g., "weight", the time the observation is valid, e.g.,
			"January 2013" or a location where the observation was made, e.g., "New
			York".</li>
		<li>To further improve interpretation of the value, attributes
			such as presentational information, e.g., a series title "COINS 2010
			to 2013" or critical information to understanding the data, e.g., the
			unit of measure "miles" can be given to observations.</li>
		<li>Given background information, e.g., arithmetical and
			comparative operations, humans and machines can appropriately
			visualize such observations or perform conversions between different
			quantities.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange [<cite><a href="#ref-SDMX">SDMX</a></cite>] — the ISO standard for exchanging and
		sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations — uses a
		"multidimensional model" to meet the above challenges in modeling
		statistics. It can describe statistics as observations. Observations
		exhibit values (Measures) that depend on dimensions (Members of
		Dimensions). Since the SDMX standard has proven applicable in many
		contexts, the Data Cube Vocabulary adopts the multidimensional model that
		underlies SDMX and will be compatible with SDMX.

	<!--OddPage--><h2 id="terminology"><span class="secno">2. </span>Terminology</h2>
	<p>
		<dfn id="dfn-statistics">Statistics</dfn>
		is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">study</a> of
		the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data.
		Statistics comprise statistical data.
	</p>

	<p>The basic structure of
		<dfn id="dfn-statistical-data">statistical data</dfn>
		is a multidimensional table (also called a data cube) [<cite><a href="#ref-SDMX">SDMX</a></cite>], i.e., a set of observed values organized
		along a group of dimensions, together with associated metadata. We
		refer to aggregated statistical data as "macro-data" and unaggregated
		statistical data as "micro-data".
	</p>
	<p>
		Statistical data can be collected in a
		<dfn id="dfn-dataset">dataset,</dfn>
		typically published and maintained by an organization [<cite><a href="#ref-SDMX">SDMX</a></cite>]. The dataset contains metadata, e.g.,
		about the time of collection and publication or about the maintaining
		and publishing organization.
	</p>

	<p>
		<dfn id="dfn-source-data">Source data</dfn>
		is data from data stores such as relational databases or spreadsheets
		that acts as a source for the Linked Data publishing process.
	</p>

	<p>
		<dfn id="dfn-metadata">Metadata</dfn>
		about statistics defines the data structure and gives contextual
		information about the statistics.
	</p>

	<p>
		A format is
		<dfn id="dfn-machine-readable">machine-readable</dfn>
		if it is amenable to automated processing by a machine, as opposed to
		presentation to a human user.
	</p>

	<p>
		A
		<dfn id="dfn-publisher">publisher</dfn>
		is a person or organization that exposes source data as Linked Data on
		the Web.
	</p>

	<p>
		A
		<dfn id="dfn-consumer">consumer</dfn>
		is a person or agent that uses Linked Data from the Web.
	</p>
	<p>
		A
		<dfn id="dfn-registry">registry</dfn>
		allows a publisher to announce that data or metadata exists and to add
		information about how to obtain that data [<cite><a href="#ref-SDMX-21">SDMX 2.1</a></cite>].
	</p>
	</section>


	<section id="use-cases">
	<!--OddPage--><h2 id="usecases"><span class="secno">3. </span>Use cases</h2>
	<p>This section presents scenarios that are enabled by the
		existence of a standard vocabulary for the representation of
		statistics as Linked Data.</p>

	<section id="sdmx-web-dissemination-use-case">
	<h3 id="SDMXWebDisseminationUseCase"><span class="secno">3.1 </span>SDMX Web Dissemination Use

		<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Use case taken from SDMX Web
			Dissemination Use Case [<cite><a href="#ref-SDMX-21">SDMX
					2.1</a></cite>])
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>Since we have adopted the multidimensional model that underlies
		SDMX, we also adopt the "Web Dissemination Use Case" which is the
		prime use case for SDMX since it is an increasingly popular use of SDMX
		and enables organizations to build a self-updating dissemination
		system.</p>
	<p>The Web Dissemination Use Case contains three actors, a
		structural metadata Web service (registry) that collects metadata
		about statistical data in a registration fashion, a data Web service
		(publisher) that publishes statistical data and its metadata as
		registered in the structural metadata Web service, and a data
		consumption application (consumer) that first discovers data from the
		registry, then queries data from the corresponding publisher of
		selected data, and then visualizes the data.</p>

	<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A structural metadata source (registry) can collect metadata
			about statistical data.</li>

		<li>A data Web service (publisher) can register statistical data
			in a registry, and can provide statistical data from a database and
			metadata from a metadata repository for consumers. For that, the
			publisher creates database tables, and loads statistical data in a
			database and metadata in a metadata repository.</li>

		<li>A consumer can discover data from a registry and
			automatically can create a query to the publisher for selected
			statistical data.</li>

		<li>The publisher can translate the query to a query to its
			database as well as metadata repository and return the statistical

		Case Study: UK government financial data from Combined Online
		Information System (COINS)</h3>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 10pt">(This use case has been
			summarized from Ian Dickinson et al. [<cite><a href="#ref-COINS">COINS</a></cite>])
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>More and more organizations want to publish statistics on the
		Web, for reasons such as increasing transparency and trust. Although,
		in the ideal case, published data can be understood by both humans and
		machines, data often is simply published as CSV, PDF, XSL etc.,
		lacking elaborate metadata, which makes free usage and analysis
		difficult.</p>
	<p>
		Therefore, the goal in this scenario is to use a machine-readable and
		application-independent description of common statistics, expressed using 
		open standards, to foster usage and innovation on the published data.
		In the "COINS as Linked Data" project [<cite><a href="#ref-COINS">COINS</a></cite>], the Combined Online Information System
		(COINS) shall be published using a standard Linked Data vocabulary.
		Via the Combined Online Information System (COINS), <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oscar-publishing-data-from-the-database">HM
			Treasury</a>, the principal custodian of financial data for the UK
		government, releases previously restricted financial information about
		government spending.
	</p>

	<p>The COINS data has a hypercube structure. It describes financial
		transactions using seven independent dimensions (time, data-type,
		department etc.) and one dependent measure (value). Also, it allows
		thirty-three attributes that may further describe each transaction.
		COINS is an example of one of the more complex statistical datasets
		being publishing via data.gov.uk.</p>
	<p>Part of the complexity of COINS arises from the nature of the
		data being released:</p>
	<p>The published COINS datasets cover expenditure related to five
		different years (2005–06 to 2009–10). The actual COINS database at HM
		Treasury is updated daily. In principle at least, multiple snapshots
		of the COINS data could be released throughout the year.</p>
	<p>The actual data and its hypercube structure are to be
		represented separately so that an application first can examine the
		structure before deciding to download the actual data, i.e., the
		transactions. The hypercube structure also defines, for each dimension
		and attribute, a range of permitted values that are to be represented.</p>
	<p>An access or query interface to the COINS data, e.g., via a
		SPARQL endpoint or the linked data API, is planned. Queries that are
		expected to be interesting are: "spending for one department", "total
		spending by department", "retrieving all data for a given observation"
		etc.</p>

	<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>
	<p>According to the COINS as Linked Data project, the reason for
		publishing COINS as Linked Data are threefold:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>using an open standard representation makes it easier to work
			with the data using available technologies and promises innovative
			third-party tools and usages;</li>
		<li>individual transactions and groups of transactions are given
			an identity, and so can be referenced by Web address (URL), to allow
			them to be discussed, annotated, or listed as source data for
			articles or visualizations;</li>
		<li>cross-links between linked-data datasets allow for much
			richer exploration of related datasets.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="challenges-1">Challenges</h3>

	<p>The COINS use case leads to the following challenges:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Although not originally intended, the Data Cube Vocabulary
			could be successfully used for publishing financial data, not just
			statistics. This has also been shown by the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/resources/payments">Payments Ontology</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Also, the publisher favors a representation that is both as
			self-descriptive as possible, i.e., others can link to and download
			fully-described individual transactions, and as compact as possible,
			i.e., information is not unnecessarily repeated. This challenge
			supports lesson: <a href="#criteriaForWell">Publishers
				and consumers may need guidance in checking and making use of
				well-formedness of published data using data cube</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Moreover, the publisher is thinking about the possible
			benefit of publishing slices of the data, e.g., datasets that fix all
			dimensions but the time dimension. For instance, such slices could be
			particularly interesting for visualizations or comments. However,
			depending on the number of dimensions, the number of possible slices
			can become large which makes it difficult to semi-automatically
			select all interesting slices. This challenge supports lesson: <a href="#clarify">Publishers
				may need more guidance in creating and managing slices or arbitrary
				groups of observations</a>.
		</li>
		<li>An important benefit of linked data is that we are able to
			annotate data, at a fine-grained level of detail, to record
			information about the data itself. This includes where it came from —
			the provenance of the data — but could include annotations from
			reviewers, links to other useful resources, etc. Being able to trust
			that data to be correct and reliable is a central value for
			government-published data, so recording provenance is a key
			requirement for the COINS data. For instance, the COINS project [<cite><a href="#ref-COINS">COINS</a></cite>] has at least four perspectives on what
			they mean by “COINS” data: the abstract notion of “all of COINS”; the
			data for a particular year; the version of the data for a particular
			year released on a given date; and the constituent graphs which hold
			both the authoritative data translated from HMT’s own sources and 
			additional supplementary information which they derive from the data,
			for example by cross-linking to other datasets. This challenge
			supports lesson: <a href="#declaringRel">Publishers
				may need guidance in making transparent the pre-processing of
				aggregate statistics</a>.
		</li>
		<li>A challenge also is the size of the data, especially since it
			is updated regularly. Five data files already contain between 3.3 and
			4.9 million rows of data. This challenge supports lesson: <a href="#mechRec">Publishers
				and consumers may need more guidance in efficiently processing data
				using the Data Cube Vocabulary</a>.

			information.)
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>Not only in government, there is a need to publish considerable
		amounts of statistical data to be consumed in various (also
		unexpected) application scenarios. Typically, Microsoft Excel sheets
		are made available for download.</p>
	<p>
		For instance, in the <a href="http://ehumanities.nl/ceda_r/">CEDA_R</a>
		and <a href="http://www.data2semantics.org/">Data2Semantics</a>
		projects publishing and harmonizing Dutch historical census data (from
		1795 onwards) is a goal. These censuses are now only available as
		Excel spreadsheets (obtained by data entry) that closely mimic the way
		in which the data was originally published and shall be published as
		Linked Data.
	</p>

	<p>Those Excel sheets contain single spreadsheets with several
		multidimensional data tables, having a name and notes, as well as
		column values, row values, and cell values.</p>

	<p>Another concrete example is the <a href="http://dl-learner.org/Projects/Stats2RDF">Stats2RDF</a>
		project that intends to publish Excel sheets with biomedical statistical data. 
		Here, Excel files are first translated 
		into CSV and then translated into RDF using OntoWiki, a semantic wiki.
	</p>

	<h3 id="benefits-2">Benefits</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The goal in this use case is to publish spreadsheet
			information in a machine-readable format on the Web, e.g., so that
			crawlers can find spreadsheets that use a certain column value. The
			published data should represent and make available for queries the
			most important information in the spreadsheets, e.g., rows, columns,
			and cell values.</li>
		<li>All context and so all meaning of the measurement point is
			expressed by means of dimensions. The pure number is the star of an
			ego-network of attributes or dimensions. In an RDF representation it
			is then easily possible to define hierarchical relationships between
			the dimensions (that can be exemplified further) as well as mapping
			different attributes across different value points. This way a
			harmonization among variables is performed around the measurement
			points themselves.</li>
		<li>Integration with provenance vocabularies, e.g.,
			PROV-O, for tracking of harmonization steps becomes possible.</li>
		<li>Once data representation and publication are standardised, consumers can focus on novel 
		visualizations and analysis interfaces of census data.</li>
		<li>In historical research, until now, harmonization across
			datasets is performed by hand, and in subsequent iterations of a
			database: it is very hard to trace back the provenance of decisions
			made during the harmonization procedure. Publishing the census data
			as Linked Data may allow (semi-)automatic harmonization.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="challenges-2">Challenges</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Semi-structured information, e.g., notes about lineage of

				is most suitable for their use case</a>.
		</li>
		<li>These challenges may seem to be particular to the field of
			historical research, but in fact apply to government information at
			large. Government is not a single body that publishes information at
			a single point in time. Government consists of multiple (altering)
			bodies, scattered across multiple levels, jurisdictions and areas.
			Publishing government information in a consistent, integrated manner

		Use Case: Publishing hierarchically structured data from StatsWales

	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 10pt">(Use case has been taken from [<cite><a href="#ref-QB4OLAP">QB4OLAP</a></cite>] and from discussions at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/publishing-statistical-data/msg/7c80f3869ff4ba0f">publishing-statistical-data
				mailing list</a>)
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>It often comes up in statistical data that you have some kind of
		'overall' figure, which is then broken down into parts.</p>

	<p>Example (in pseudo-turtle RDF):</p>
	<pre>ex:obs1
  sdmx:refArea &lt;uk&gt;;
  sdmx:refPeriod "2011";
  ex:population "60" .
ex:obs2
  sdmx:refArea &lt;england&gt;;
  sdmx:refPeriod "2011";
  ex:population "50" .
ex:obs3
  sdmx:refArea &lt;scotland&gt;;
  sdmx:refPeriod "2011";
  ex:population "5" .
ex:obs4
  sdmx:refArea &lt;wales&gt;;
  sdmx:refPeriod "2011";
  ex:population "3" .
ex:obs5
  sdmx:refArea &lt;northernireland&gt;;
  sdmx:refPeriod "2011";
  ex:population "2" .	</pre>

	<p>
		We are looking for the best way (in the context of the RDF/Data
		Cube/SDMX approach) to express that the values for
		England, Scotland, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland ought to add up to the value
		for the UK and constitute a more detailed breakdown of the overall UK
		figure. Since we might also have population figures for France,
		Germany, EU28 etc., it is not as simple as just taking a
		<code>qb:Slice</code> where you fix the time period and the measure.
	</p>

	<p>Similarly, Etcheverry and Vaisman [<cite><a href="#ref-QB4OLAP">QB4OLAP</a></cite>]
		present the use case to publish household data from <a href="http://statswales.wales.gov.uk/index.htm">StatsWales</a> and <a href="http://opendatacommunities.org/themes/households">Open
			Data Communities</a>.
	</p>

	<p>This multidimensional data contains for each fact a time
		dimension with one level Year and a location dimension with levels
		Unitary Authority, Government Office Region, Country, and ALL. As
		unit, units of 1000 households is used.</p>

	<p>In this use case, one wants to publish not only a dataset on the
		bottom most level, i.e., what are the number of households at each
		Unitary Authority in each year, but also a dataset on more aggregated
		levels. For instance, in order to publish a dataset with the number of
		households at each Government Office Region per year, one needs to
		aggregate the measure of each fact having the same Government Office
		Region using the SUM function.</p>

	<p>Similarly, for many uses then population broken down by some
		category (e.g., ethnicity) is expressed as a percentage. Separate
		datasets give the actual counts per category and aggregate counts. In
		such cases it is common to talk about the denominator (often DENOM)
		which is the aggregate count against which the percentages can be
		interpreted.</p>

	<h3 id="benefits-3">Benefits</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Expressing aggregation relationships would allow query
			engines to automatically derive statistics on higher aggregation
			levels.</li>
		<li>Vice versa, representing further aggregated datasets would
			allow the answering of queries with a simple lookup instead of computations
			which may be more time consuming or require specific features of the
			query engine (e.g., SPARQL 1.1).</li>
	</ul>


	<h3 id="challenges-3">Challenges</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Importantly, one would like to maintain the relationship
			between the resulting datasets, i.e., the levels and aggregation
			functions. Again, this use case does not simply need a selection (or
			"dice" in OLAP context) where one fixes the time period dimension, but includes aggregation. 
			This supports lesson <a href="#aggregations">Publishers
				may need guidance in how to represent common analytical operations
				such as Slice, Dice, Rollup on data cubes</a>
		</li>
		<li>Literals that are used in observations cannot be used as
			subjects in triples. So no hierarchies can be defined that would, for
			example, link integer years via skos:narrower to months. This supports
			lesson <a href="#heirarchic">Publishers
				may need more guidance to decide which representation of hierarchies

		As part of their work with data.gov.uk and the UK Location Programme,

	</p>
	<p>The UK has a number of areas, typically beaches, that are
		designated as bathing waters where people routinely enter the water.
		The Environment Agency monitors and reports on the quality of the
		water at these bathing waters.</p>
	<p>The Environment Agency's data can be thought of as structured
		in 3 groups:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>basic reference data describing the bathing waters

		<li>"Annual Compliance Assessment Dataset"

			giving the detailed weekly sampling results for each bathing water.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The most important dimensions of the data are bathing water,

	<h3 id="benefits-4">Benefits</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The bathing-water dataset (documentation) is structured

	<h3 id="challenges-4">Challenges</h3>

		weather forecasts from Met Office, the UK's National Weather Service</h3>
	<span style="font-size: 10pt">(This section contributed by Dave
		Reynolds)</span>

	<p>The Met Office, the UK's National Weather Service, provides a
		range of weather forecast products including openly available
		site-specific forecasts for the UK. The site specific forecasts cover
		over 5000 forecast points, each forecast predicts 10 parameters and
		spans a 5 day window at 3 hourly intervals, the whole forecast is
		updated each hour. A proof of concept project investigated the
		challenge of publishing this information as linked data using the Data
		Cube vocabulary.</p>

	<h3 id="benefits-5">Benefits</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Explicit metadata describing the forecast process, coverage
			and phenomena being forecast; making the data self-describing.</li>

		<li>Linking to other linked data resources (particularly

			locations) enabling discovery of related data.</li>

		<li>Ability to define slices through the data for convenient
			consumption by applications.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="challenges-5">Challenges</h3>

	<p>This weather forecasts case study leads to the following
		challenges:</p>

	<h3 id="iso19156-compatibility">ISO19156 compatibility</h3>

	<p>
		The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) develops and recommends
		data interchange standard and within that community compatibility with
		ISO19156 <em>"Geographic information — Observations and
			measurements"</em> (O&amp;M) is regarded as important. Thus, this supports
		lesson <a href="#relToSO19156">Modelers
			using ISO19156 - Observations &amp; Measurements may need
			clarification regarding the relationship to the Data Cube Vocabulary</a>.
	</p>
	<b>Solution in this case study:</b>
	<p>O&amp;M provides a data model for an Observation with associated
		Phenomenon, measurement ProcessUsed, Domain (feature of interest) and
		Result. Prototype vocabularies developed at CSIRO and extended within
		this project allow this data model to be represented in RDF. For the
		site specific forecasts then a 5-day forecast for all 5000+ sites is
		regarded as a single O&amp;M Observation.</p>
	<p>
		To represent the forecast data itself, the Result in the O&amp;M
		model, then the relevant standard is ISO19123 <em>"Geographic
			information — Schema for coverage geometry and functions"</em>. This
		provides a data model for a Coverage which can represent a set of
		values across some space. It defines different types of Coverage
		including a DiscretePointCoverage suited to representing site-specific
		forecast results.
	</p>
	<p>It turns out that it is straightforward to treat an RDF Data
		Cube as a particular concrete representation of the
		DiscretePointCoverage logical model. The cube has dimensions
		corresponding to the forecast time and location and the measure is a
		record representing the forecast values of the 10 phenomena. Slices by
		time and location provide subsets of the data that directly match the
		data packages supported by an existing on-line service.</p>
	<p>
		Note that in this situation an <em>observation</em> in the sense of
		<code>qb:Observation</code>
		and an <em>observation</em> in the sense of ISO19156 Observations and
		Measurements are different things. The O&amp;M Observation is the
		whole forecast whereas each
		<code>qb:Observation</code>
		corresponds to a single GeometryValuePair within the forecast results
		Coverage.
	</p>

	<p></p>
	<h3 id="data-volume">Data volume</h3>
	<p>
		Each hourly update comprises over 2 million data points and forecast
		data is requested by a large number of data consumers. Bandwidth costs
		are thus a key consideration and the apparent verbosity of RDF in
		general, and Data Cube specifically, was a concern. This supports
		lesson <a href="#mechRec">
			Publishers and consumers may need more guidance in efficiently
			processing data using the Data Cube Vocabulary</a>.
	</p>
	<b>Solution in this case study:</b>
	<p>Regarding bandwidth costs then the key is not raw data volume
		but compressibility, since such data is transmitted in compressed
		form. A Turtle representation of a non-abbreviated data cube
		compressed to within 15-20% of the size of compressed, handcrafted XML
		and JSON representations. Thus obviating the need for abbreviations or
		custom serialization.</p>

	<p>
		As mentioned already, the ISO standard for exchanging and sharing

		Data.
	</p>

	<p>
		As one of the main adopters of SDMX, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/">Eurostat</a> publishes large
		amounts of European statistics coming from a data warehouse as SDMX
		and other formats on the Web. Eurostat also provides an interface to

		downloading of interesting datasets and manual integration. The goal
		here is to improve integration with other datasets; Eurostat data
		should be published on the Web in a machine-readable format, possibly
		to be linked with other datasets, and possibly to be freely consumed
		by applications. Both <a href="http://estatwrap.ontologycentral.com/">Eurostat
			Linked Data Wrapper</a> and <a href="http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/">Linked Statistics

	<h3 id="challenges-6">Challenges</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>There is a large number of Eurostat datasets, each possibly
			containing a large number of columns (dimensions) and rows
			(observations). Eurostat publishes more than 5200 datasets, which,
			when converted into RDF require more than 350GB of disk space
			yielding a dataspace with some 8 billion triples. This supports
			lesson <a href="#mechRec">
				Publishers and consumers may need more guidance in efficiently
				processing data using the Data Cube Vocabulary.</a>
		</li>

		<li>In the Eurostat Linked Data Wrapper, there is a timeout for
			transforming SDMX to Linked Data, since Google App Engine is used.
			Mechanisms to reduce the amount of data that needs to be translated
			would be needed, again supporting lesson <a href="#mechRec">
				Publishers and consumers may need more guidance in efficiently
				processing data using the Data Cube Vocabulary.</a>
		</li>

		<li>Each dimension used by a dataset has a range of permitted
			values that need to be described.</li>

		<li>The Eurostat SDMX as Linked Data use case provides data on a
			gender level and on a level aggregating over the gender level. This
			suggests a need to have time lines on data aggregating over the gender
			dimension, supporting the lesson: <a href="#aggregations">
				Publishers may need guidance in how to represent common analytical
				operations such as Slice, Dice, Rollup on data cubes</a>.
		</li>

		<li>New Eurostat datasets are added regularly to Eurostat. The
			Linked Data representation should automatically provide access to the
			most-up-to-date data:

			<ul>
				<li>Eurostat Linked Data pulls in changes from the original
					Eurostat dataset on a weekly basis and the conversion process runs
					every Saturday at noon taking into account new datasets along with
					updates to existing datasets.</li>
				<li>Eurostat Linked Data Wrapper translates Eurostat
					datasets into RDF on the fly so that the most current data is always used. The
					problem is only to point users towards the URIs of Eurostat
					datasets: Estatwrap provides a feed of modified and new <a href="http://estatwrap.ontologycentral.com/feed.rdf">datasets</a>.
					Also, it provides a <a href="http://estatwrap.ontologycentral.com/table_of_contents.html">TOC</a>
					that could be automatically updated from the <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=1&amp;file=table_of_contents_en.xml">Eurostat
						TOC</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>


		</li>

		<li>Query interface

		<ul>
			<li>Eurostat Linked Data provides a SPARQL endpoint for the
				metadata (not the observations).</li>
			<li>Eurostat Linked Data Wrapper provides resolvable URIs to
				datasets (ds) that return all observations of the dataset. Also,
				every dataset serves the URI of its data structure definition (dsd).
				The dsd URI returns all RDF describing the dataset. Separating
				information resources for dataset and data structure definition
				allows one, for example, to first gather the dsd and only for actual query
				execution to resolve the ds.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Providing a useful interface for browsing and visualizing the
			data:
			<ul>
			
					<li>One problem is that the data sets have too high dimensionality
			to be displayed directly. Instead, one could visualize slices of time
			series data. However, for that, one would need to either fix most
			other dimensions (e.g., sex) or aggregate over them (e.g., via
			average). The selection of useful slices from the large number of
			possible slices is a challenge. This supports lesson <a href="#clarify">
				Publishers may need more guidance in creating and managing slices or
				arbitrary groups of observations</a>.
		</li>
			
				<li>Eurostat Linked Data Wrapper provides for each dataset an
					HTML page showing a JavaScript-based visualization of the data.
					This also supports lesson <a href="#consumers">
						Consumers may need guidance in conversions into formats that can
						easily be displayed and further investigated in tools such as
						Google Data Explorer, R, Weka etc.</a>
				</li>
			</ul>


		</li>
		<li>One possible application would run validation checks over
			Eurostat data. However, the Data Cube Vocabulary is designed to publish
			statistical data as-is and is not intended to represent information
			for validation (similar to business rules).</li>
		<li>An application could try to automatically match elements of
			the geo-spatial dimension to elements of other data sources, e.g.,
			NUTS, GADM. In Eurostat Linked Data wrapper this is done by simple
			URI guessing from external data sources. Automatic linking datasets
			or linking datasets with metadata is not part of Data Cube
			Vocabulary.</li>
		<li>The draft version of the Data Cube Vocabulary builds upon SDMX Standards Version 2.0. 
A newer version of SDMX, SDMX Standards, Version 2.1, is available which might be used by 
Eurostat in the future which supports lesson <a href="#putative">
						There is a putative requirement to update to SDMX 2.1 if there are specific use cases that demand it</a>.</li>

		<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/publicdata/">Google Public

	</p>

	<p>
		Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) [<cite><a href="#ref-OLAP">OLAP</a></cite>]
		is an analysis method on multidimensional data. It is an explorative
		analysis method that allows users to interactively view the data on
		different angles (rotate, select) or granularities (drill-down,
		roll-up), and filter it for specific information (slice, dice).
	</p>

	<p>OLAP systems are commonly used in industry to analyze statistical data
		on a regular basis. OLAP systems first use ETL pipelines to
		extract-load-transform relevant data 
		in a data warehouse and then allow interfaces to efficiently issue OLAP queries
		on the data.</p>

	<p>
		The goal in this use case is to allow analysis of published
		statistical data with common OLAP systems [<cite><a href="#ref-OLAP4LD">OLAP4LD</a></cite>].
	</p>

	<p>For that a multidimensional model of the data needs to be
		generated. A multidimensional model consists of facts summarized in
		data cubes. Facts exhibit measures depending on members of dimensions.
		Members of dimensions can be further structured along hierarchies of
		levels.</p>

	<p>
		An example scenario of this use case is the Financial Information
		Observation System (FIOS) [<cite><a href="#ref-FIOS">FIOS</a></cite>],
		where XBRL data provided by the SEC on the Web is re-published as
		Linked Data and made possible to explore and analyze by stakeholders
		in a Web-based OLAP client Saiku.

	<p>The following figure shows an example of using FIOS. Here, for

	<p>
		After statistics have been published as Linked Data, the question
		remains how to communicate the publication and to let users discover
