<H2>Status of this document</H2>

<P>This document is a work in progress representing the current consensus of the W3C Scalable 
Vector Graphics Working Group. This draft of the SVG Requirements document
has been approved by the SVG working group to be posted for review by W3C members and 
other interested parties. It is the first public review draft of this document.  
Publication as a working draft does not imply
endorsement by the W3C membership.</p>

<P>Review comments from the public should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:www-svg@w3.org">www-svg@w3.org</A>,
which is an automatically <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/">archived</a>
 email list. Information on how to subscribe

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The W3C has chartered a Scalable Vector Graphics working group
to produce a specification for an SVG format, 
written as a modular XML tagset and usable as an XML namespace, 
which can be widely implemented in browsers and authoring tools 
and which is suitable for widespread adoption 
by the content authoring community 
as a replacement for many current uses of raster graphics.</P>

<P>This will mean that the graphics in Web documents will be 
smaller, faster, more interactive, and 
be displayable on a wider range of device resolutions 
from small mobile devices through office computer monitors 
to high resolution printers. This will be a significant advance 
in Web functionality. Interoperability, both in multiple browsers 
across multiple platforms and in multiple authoring tools (both read and write), 
is a prime focus.</P>

<P>The SVG working group decided to solicit public review and
feedback at the earliest possible point to best ensure that SVG
meets the Web community's needs for a vector graphics language
specification. This document reflects early SVG working group
discussions on what SVG should and should
not be. The working group has not reached consensus on all topics,
so the document below sometimes describes particular features
as open issues that are still under discussion.</P>

<P>This document lists both SVG Design Goals and SVG Detailed Requirements.
The SVG Design Goals describe the high-level objectives which
SVG should attempt to achieve. These design goals should also
act as the criteria by which proposed features are judged. The
SVG Detailed Requirements contains the actual list of proposed
features.</P>

<P>A first draft of the detailed specification for SVG will be made available a couple
of months after the posting of this requirements document for public review. The
specification will be developed largely by looking at:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the design goals and detailed requirements that are contained
  in this document
  <LI>review comments on this document from public feedback, invited experts
  and working group members
</UL>

<h1><A NAME="SVGDesignGoals"></A>SVG Design Goals</h1>

<P>The following are the Design Goals for SVG. Besides providing
a set of high-level objectives for SVG, these goals act as the
criteria by which proposed features are judged. Thus, the features
list shown below under SVG Detailed Requirements should reflect
the higher-level goals listed here.</P>

<P>These SVG Design Goals are not listed in any particular order.
It is recognized that some of the goals might conflict or be unachievable
and that tradeoffs will need to be made.</P>



<A NAME="DGOpenSpecification"> </A>
<H2>Open specification</H2>
<OL class="DESIGNGOALS">
  <LI>The specification should be controlled by the members in the
  W3C, not by a single vendor. Thus, the specification should not
  subject to sudden change by a single vendor.
  <LI>The specification
  should be vendor neutral and thus should not contain features
  biased towards a particular vendor.
</ol>

<A NAME="DGWidelyImplemented"> </A>
<H2>Widely implemented and supported</H2>

<OL class="DESIGNGOALS">
  <LI value="3">SVG should be a standard feature in Web browsers
  <LI>Implementations of SVG should be consistent so that the same
  visual results and behaviors exist in all conforming SVG processors.
  <LI>There should not be subset problems and incompatible generator/reader
  sets. Thus, there should be a single language specification,
  not a set of layered language specifications.
  <LI>There should be widespread support in authoring applications and related tools
  <LI>To promote widespread adoption and support, SVG should be specified to be 
  as basic and simple as possible while still providing necessary features 
  to satisfy the needs of graphics on the Web. 
  While the chief goal is to aim at the middle ground, 
  a basic and simple feature set will allow it to be used on devices 
  with a wide range of resolutions and capabilities, 
  from small mobile devices through office computer monitors to high resolution printers.
  <LI>Straightforward generation via hand-authoring with a text editor
  or server-side scripts (e.g., CGI)
  <LI>SVG should be as self-contained as possible.
  While SVG should leverage and be compatible with other W3C work,
  it should attempt to do so without introducing
  excessive dependencies on other specifications.
  <LI>Ready availability to the casual implementor is desirable
  <LI>Reference source code is desirable
</ol>

<A NAME="DGRelationshipOther"></A>
<H2>Relationship to other Web standards efforts</H2>

<OL class="DESIGNGOALS">
  <LI value="12">Defined as an application of XML
  <LI>Compatible with and/or leverages other relevant standards
  efforts, including XML namespaces, XML links (XLink), DOM, CSS, XSL and
  metadata.For example: 
    <UL>
	  <LI>the elements and attributes of an SVG
          drawing should be scriptable via the DOM
	  <LI>text should be expressed
          as XML character data so that it can be found by search engines
      <LI>attributes which make
          sense to be part of a style should be expressed in CSS
    </UL>
   The SVG working group will need to coordinate proactively
   with other working groups when it is more appropriate to meet the SVG
   requirements through modifications to other Recommendations.
</ol>

<A NAME="DGGraphicFeatures"></A>
<H2>Graphics features</H2>

<OL class="DESIGNGOALS">
  <LI value="14">Complete, general-purpose Web vector graphics format that
  satisfactorily meets the graphics delivery needs for all creators
  and consumers of Web vector graphics
  <LI>Sufficiently powerful and precise to meet the needs of professional
  Web graphic designers such that they will utilize SVG instead
  of raster formats in those cases where vector graphics is a more
  natural or appropriate format
  <LI>Sufficiently powerful to meet the needs of 
  business presentation and diagramming applications such that 
  these drawings will be published on the Web using SVG instead of raster formats
  <LI>Feature set is rich enough such that a reasonable conversion of
  most existing standard static graphics files into SVG is possible
  <LI>Sufficiently compatible with the graphics design and
  publishing industries' feature sets and file formats 
  such that there is (as lossless as possible) a straightforward mapping
  from these applications and file formats 
  into SVG. The goals are to facilitate
  conversion of existing artwork into SVG, promote the creation of lots
  of compelling new SVG artwork, make it as easy as possible for the graphics design
  and publishing industries to adapt existing authoring tools, and provide for
  new SVG authoring tools.
  <LI>Compatible with the needs of non-technical persons who want
  a straightforward way to generate relatively simple graphics
  either by hand-editing or via server-based graphics generation
  (e.g., CGI scripts).
  <LI>Compatible with high-quality, efficient printing at full
  printer resolution and with reliable color
  <LI>Focused on basic foundation, presentation-level graphics
  facilities, with a critical eye toward higher-level (model-level) constructs which
  might be better suited to a higher-level standard which would sit
  on top of SVG
  <LI>The working group is investigating whether other Web standards
  (e.g., CSS, XSL, MathML, Web Schematics) could use SVG as its
  low-level rendering specification. 
  (This goal has significant dependencies on other W3C initiatives such as the
  W3C Formatting Model and might change accordingly.) 
  <LI>The specification for SVG should take into account the possibility of
  building a future 3D graphics specification which either sits on top of SVG
  or which is entirely independent but with a similar syntax; however, the
  SVG working group should not let itself be slowed down or constrained by 3D
  upgrade path issues.

<A NAME="DGInteractivityDynamism"></A>
<H2>Interactivity and Dynamic Behaviors</H2>

<OL class="DESIGNGOALS">
  <LI value="24">Allows for interactive and dynamic Web pages

  <LI>Mechanisms for inclusion of application-specific (or industry
  specific) private data which would facilitate use of SVG as a

<h1><A NAME="SVGDetailedRequirements"></A>SVG Detailed
Requirements</h1>

<P>The following is the detailed list of required features and
capabilities in SVG. Items which are already listed as a Design
Goal are not repeated here. It is recognized that some of these 
requirements might conflict or may not be possible.</P>


<A NAME="DRGeneralRequirements"></A>
<H2>General requirements</H2>

<OL class="REQT-LEVEL0">
  
  <LI><A NAME="DRConsistent"></A>Consistent visual results and behaviors across implementations
    <OL class="REQT-LEVEL1">
	  <LI>The specification needs to be complete and unambiguous
      <LI>The goal is to have at least two independent implementations
          each of SVG viewers and SVG generators under development as the
          specification is defined to help find and remove ambiguities 
		  from the specification.
      <LI>An extensive conformance test suite needs to be delivered
          in conjunction with the final specification.

  <LI><A NAME="DRElegant"></A>Elegant, uniform, complete and consistent
    <OL class="REQT-LEVEL1">
	  <LI>Wherever possible, all graphical attributes and
	      operations should be available to all object types. For example,
		  if 2x3 transformation matrices are available for shape objects, then
		  2x3 transformation matrices should also be available for
		  text and image objects.
	</OL>
 
 
  <LI> <A NAME="DRPackaging"></A>Packaging
    <OL class="REQT-LEVEL1">
	  <LI>Stand-alone packaging: Compatible with the need of stand-alone
	  graphics authoring packages. It should be possible
	  for a graphics authoring application to save a stand-alone SVG
	  file. (&quot;Stand-alone packaging&quot; means that an SVG file
	  is saved as a separate, self-contained file, probably with a
	  .svg extension on platforms where the extension is important.)
	  <LI>Fragment packaging: Compatible with the need of consolidated
	  full-page Web authoring packages which would like to author/deliver
	  full pages of XML with optional vector graphics elements
	  interspersed as isolated components within the page. (&quot;Fragment
	  packaging&quot; means that snippets of SVG would appear inside
	  the content of a parent XML grammar. For example, a picture
	  of an arrow expressed in SVG might appear inline within an XML
	  file. The expected way this would be achieved would be by referencing
	  the SVG namespace within the XML file.)

    <OL class="REQT-LEVEL1">
	  <LI>The working group should investigate
      the issue of alternative representations in the form of text strings
	  or image data. Alternate representations as text or images
	  might provide a good answer for backwards compatibility in some cases
	  or provide for a faster display option for some drawings.

     <OL class="REQT-LEVEL1">
	  <LI>By virtue of being written in XML, SVG will already have

      <LI>All text/font attributes from CSS should be supported. Complete support for
		  CSS is what the Web community will expect.
	      (See <A href="#DRCSSSupport">CSS support</A>, below)
      <LI>It is clear that precise text sizing/positioning is a requirement for the 
	      graphics design community.
		  Thus, SVG should allow for precise control of text sizing, positioning,
          rotation, and skewing on a character-by-character basis. In particular,
          the working group should look to see if this feature could be packaged as
		  to provide for precise text on a path.
      <LI>It is clear that precise control of fonts and glyphs is a requirement for the 
	      graphics design community.
		  It should be possible to achieve precise control of the exact font and the exact glyphs
          within a given font to use for a given character sequence so that
          graphic artists have a way to ensure that the end user sees what was
          intended
      <LI>The same fill/stroke/clip/mask capabilities that can be used with 
          vector data should also be available to text data. For example,
          it should be possible to fill a text string with a gradient or
          stroke it with a dashed line pattern. This is a widely used
		  feature in the graphics design world and is required for compatibility
		  with existing graphics content.
	  <LI>The working group hasn't investigated yet whether it is advisable to
	      provide a capability to automatically position a text string relative
		  to another graphical element (e.g., automatically centering a text string
		  within a rectangle). It is clear that such a feature would be a great
		  convenience for hand-coders of certain types of drawings, such as diagrams.
		  The working group
		  should investigate whether there is an easy-to-use (for a hand-coder)
		  yet robust and elegant way of achieving this.
	  <LI>Having a text string determine the dimensions of a parent graphical object
	      (e.g., a box is drawn to fit around a text string) is too high-level of
		  a construct and is not planned for version 1 of SVG.
	  <LI>Adding a text-on-a-path capability to SVG is still under consideration. 
	      The working group recognizes that there are many
		  technical complexities which make it difficult to design the

      <LI>It is clear that reliable color is important to both end users and

		  sRGB does not answer all precise color needs, and most desktop platforms
	      support the more complete ICC-based color management system.
		  Thus, an alternative ICC-based color representation should be available for all
          color attributes. If the SVG processor supports color management, then
          the ICC color takes precedence over the sRGB color.
	  <LI>There has been little discussion so far on sport color support. Spot

		  to many transparency needs, wherever a color property is allowed,
		  there will be a corresponding opacity property which indicates how
		  transparent a given object/component/attribute
          should be when blended into its background
      <LI>In group opacity, the collection
          of objects that makes up a group is (in effect) drawn into a
          temporary area in memory, and then the temporary area is blended
          as a single unit into the background graphics. 
          Group opacity is necessary when you have an aggregate object such as a automobile
          which is drawn as a collection of overlapping, opaque components
          (e.g., the hubcap might be an opaque circle that is drawn on top of
          an opaque tire) and you want to blend that object as a unit into
          the background. Group opacity is a requirement for many animation
		  applications and has utility with static graphics also.
		  It is straightforward to implement, particularly once you have
		  support for transparent image objects, which is needed for GIF and PNG.
		  It is infeasible to achieve these effects without this feature.
		  Thus, group opacity should be supported in SVG.
     <LI>The working group decided that identification of 
	      a transparency/blue-screen/chromaKey
	      color will not be supported for shapes and text because the opacity
		  features are sufficient. However, the transparency color feature
		  that exists in image file formats such as GIF and PNG will be supported.
